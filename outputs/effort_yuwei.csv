The causative agents of some CNS infections have distinct spatial and temporal patterns.Here we present the results of a spatial epidemiological and ecological analysis of CNS infections in Lao PDR (2003-2011). The data came from hospitalizations for suspected CNS infection at Mahosot Hospital in Vientiane. Out of 1,065 patients, 450 were assigned a confirmed diagnosis. While many communities in Lao PDR are in rural and remote locations, most patients in these data came from villages along major roads. Japanese encephalitis virus ((JEV); n = 94) and Cryptococcus spp. (n = 70) were the most common infections. JEV infections peaked in the rainy season and JEV patients came from villages with higher surface flooding during the same month as admission. JEV infections were spatially dispersed throughout rural areas and were most common in children. Cryptococcus spp. infections clustered near Vientiane (an urban area) and among adults.The spatial and temporal patterns identified in this analysis are related to complex environmental, social, and geographic factors. For example, JEV infected patients came from locations with environmental conditions (surface water) that are suitable to support larger mosquito vector populations. Most patients in these data came from villages that are near major roads; likely the result of geographic and financial access to healthcare and also indicating that CNS diseases are underestimated in the region (especially from more remote areas). As Lao PDR is undergoing major developmental and environmental changes, the space-time distributions of the causative agents of CNS infection will also likely change. There is a major need for increased diagnostic abilities; increased access to healthcare, especially for rural populations; and for increased surveillance throughout the nation."

Methods: Follow-up was conducted for 112 hospitalized patients with Japanese encephalitis (JE) in adults at the Department of Neurology of three hospitals in Gansu province from July to October 2016, from July to October 2017, 6 months and 1 year after onset, respectively. The neurological functional recovery was evaluated by modified Ranking Scale (mRS).The influencing factors were analyzed by logistic regression model. Results: Among the 112 adult patients with JE after 1year follow-up, 57% (64/112) were completely recovered (mRS score=0), and 14%(16/112) had mild neurological dysfunction (mRS score=1 or 2 points), 20% (22/112) had moderate to severe neurological dysfunction (mRS score 3 to 5), and 9% (10/112) died. In 102 survivors, decreased consciousness were fully recovered (100%), 75% of the mental and behavior disorders, 64% of cognitive/memory impairment, 71% of language function disorder, 61% of paralysis, 73% of extrapyramidal symptoms were fully recovered, and 92% of the seizures were controlled. Comparison of clinical data of initial on-set between good prognosis group (mRS score≤2, 80 cases) and poor prognosis group (mRS score>2, 32 cases) showed that initial clinical manifestation with seizures, consciousness (GCS score), cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and lesion of MRI involved in midbrain had statistically significant differences (all P<0.05) . Multivariate analysis demonstrated that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure>250 mmH(2)O and lesion of midbrain in MRI were independent risk factors of poor prognosis in adult patients with JE. Conclusion: JE is an acute and infectious viral encephalitis of the central nervous system with high disability and mortality. Most patients were completely recovered, and some had neurological sequelae. CSF pressure>250 mmH(2)O and lesion of midbrain in MRI are independent risk factors for poor prognosis."

However, there has been a lack of a JE epidemic systematic analysis, which is urgently needed to guide control and prevention efforts.This study explored and described the spatiotemporal distribution of JE cases observed among two different age groups in Yunnan Province from 2007 to 2017. The epidemiological features and spatial features were analyzed according to basic statistics, ArcGIS software (version 9.3; ESRI, Redlands, CA) and SPSS software (version 20; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York).Overall, the whole province had a high incidence of JE. The annual incidence rates in 2007 and 2017 were 1.668/100,000 and 0.158/100,000, respectively. The annual mortality was under 0.095/100,000 for these years. Although the whole province was in danger of JE, the Diqing autonomous prefecture and the Lijiang autonomous prefecture had no JE cases recorded for over 10 years. The JE cases were reported by hospitals located in 60 counties of 14 municipalities. The top ten areas with the most JE cases were Kunming City, Zhaotong City, Jinghong City, Wenshan City, Mangshi City, Pu'er City, Baoshan City, Dali City, Chuxiong City, and Gejiu City. The incidence declined smoothly, with a peak occurring from June to September, which accounted for 96.1% of the total cases. Children whose age was equal or less than 10 years old (LEQ10) still maintained a high frequency of JEV infection, and a large number of cases were reported in August, despite the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), which was established in April 2008. There was no difference in the quantity of cases between the two groups (t = -0.411, P>0.05); additionally, the number of JE cases among patients LEQ10 were significantly greater than those among patients older than 10 years (GTR10). Further analysis using local indicators of spatial association (LISA) revealed that the distribution of JE exhibited a high-high cluster characteristic (Z = 2.06, P<0.05), which showed that Jinghong City, Guangnan County, Yanshan County, Funing County, and Mengzi City were hot spots for the JE epidemic.Although the EPI was established in 2008 and the incidence of JE declined smoothly in Yunnan Province, there was no difference in the number of cases between the two age groups, which reveals that the EPI has been conducted with a low level success. In the context of limited vaccine supply capacity, we should strengthen the implementation of the children's immunization program before strengthening other immunization programs."

Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) invades the CNS, resulting in neuroinflammation, which turns the neuroprotective role of microglia detrimental as characterized by increased microglial activation and neuronal death. Several host factors, including microRNAs, play vital roles in regulating virus-induced inflammation. In the current study, we demonstrate that the expression of miR-301a is increased in JEV-infected microglial cells and human brain. Overexpression of miR-301a augments the JEV-induced inflammatory response, whereas inhibition of miR-301a completely reverses the effects. Mechanistically, NF-κB-repressing factor (NKRF) functioning as inhibitor of NF-κB activation is identified as a potential target of miR-301a in JEV infection. Consequently, miR-301a-mediated inhibition of NKRF enhances nuclear translocation of NF-κB, which, in turn, resulted in amplified inflammatory response. Conversely, NKRF overexpression in miR-301a-inhibited condition restores nuclear accumulation of NF-κB to a basal level. We also observed that JEV infection induces classical activation (M1) of microglia that drives the production of proinflammatory cytokines while suppressing alternative activation (M2) that could serve to dampen the inflammatory response. Furthermore, in vivo neutralization of miR-301a in mouse brain restores NKRF expression, thereby reducing inflammatory response, microglial activation, and neuronal apoptosis. Thus, our study suggests that the JEV-induced expression of miR-301a positively regulates inflammatory response by suppressing NKRF production, which might be targeted to manage viral-induced neuroinflammation.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc."

However, the mechanism of JEV-induced neuronal apoptosis has not been clearly elucidated. This study aimed to investigate both virus replication and neuronal cell apoptosis during JEV infection in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. As a result, the kinetic productions of new viral progeny were time- and dose-dependent. The stimulation of SH-SY5Y cell apoptosis was dependent on the multiplicity of infections (MOIs) and infection periods, particularly during the late period of infection. Interestingly, we observed that of full-length Bax (p21 Bax) level started to decrease, which corresponded to the increased level of its cleaved form (p18 Bax). The formation of p18 Bax resulting in cytochrome c release into the cytosol appeared to correlate with JEV-induced apoptotic cell death together with the activation of caspase-3/7 activity, especially during the late stage of a robust viral infection. Therefore, our results suggest another possible mechanism of JEV-induced apoptotic cell death via the induction of the proteolysis of endogenous p21 Bax to generate p18 Bax. This finding could be a new avenue to facilitate novel drug discovery for the further development of therapeutic treatments that could relieve neuronal damage from JEV infection."

Uncontrolled inflammatory responses in the central nervous system (CNS) are a hallmark of severe JE. Although the CCR2-CCL2 axis is important for monocytes trafficking during JEV infection, little is known about its role in CNS trafficking of CD8+ T cells. Here, we characterized a mouse model of JEV infection, induced via intravenous injection (i.v.) and delineated the chemokines and infiltrating peripheral immune cells in the brains of infected mice. The CNS expression of chemokines, Ccl2, Ccl3, and Ccl5, and their receptors, Ccr2 or Ccr5, was significantly up-regulated after JEV infection and was associated with the degree of JE pathogenesis. Moreover, JEV infection resulted in the migration of a large number of CD8+ T cells into the CNS. In the brains of JEV-infected mice, infiltrating CD8+ T cells expressed CCR2 and CCR5 and were found to comprise mainly effector T cells (CD44+CD62L-). JEV infection dramatically enhanced the expression of programmed death 1 (PD-1) on infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the brain, as compared to that on peripheral CD8+ T cells in the spleen. This effect was more pronounced on infiltrating CCR2+CD8+ T cells than on CCR2-CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, we identified a new subset of CD8+ T cells (PD1+CCR2+CD8+ T cells) present in the CNS of mice during acute JEV infection. These CD8+ T cells might play a role in JE pathogenesis."

Strongylus vulgaris infection with severe arterial lesions and hemomelasma ilei was present in all necropsied horses. We frequently found intestinal ulcers, perihepatitis filamentosa, and poor body condition. We recorded degenerative arthropathy in metacarpophalangeal joints in two cases and a fracture of the rib with diaphragmatic rupture in one case. A total of 73% (177/242) of horses were seropositive for JEV as tested by hemagglutination inhibition (HI). The HI data also revealed that 74% (59/80) of the wild boars, 67% (60/90) of the pigs, and 29% (22/75) of the wild monkeys were seropositive for JEV. Our findings showed that Strongylus spp. are still a risk to horses in this region, and that environmental factors such as topographic location of the pasture and steep slope may have caused of degenerative arthropathy and bone fracture. Our results showed that JEV is endemic in Japan. The wild boars and pigs were presumed to act as strong amplifiers and sources of infection, with subsequent risk to humans."

JEV infection in sows primarily manifests as a reproductive disease such as abortion and transient infertility while in infected boars, it can cause orchitis. Previous studies mainly focused on the pathogenesis of human encephalitis caused by JEV infection, while few concentrations have been made to unveil the potential mechanism of reproductive dysfunction in JEV-infected pigs. In this study, histopathological analysis and immunohistochemistry staining was performed on testis of JEV-infected boars, indicating that JEV could infect testicular cells and cause inflammatory changes in testis. In vitro assays reveal that primary swine testicular cells and swine testis (ST) cells are highly permissive to JEV and significant inflammatory response was shown during JEV infection. Mechanically, we found that JEV infection increases the expression of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and activates transcription factor NF-κB. Production of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines was greatly reduced in JEV infected testicular cells after knockout of RIG-I or treatment with the NF-κB speciﬁc inhibitor. In addition, activation of NF-κB was also significantly suppressed upon RIG-I knockout. Taken together, our results reveal that JEV could infect boar testicles, and RIG-I-NF-κB signaling pathway is involved in JEV-induced inflammation in swine testicular cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The clinical presentations and outcome of the infection is dependent upon both virulence of viral determinants and host immune responses. The causative pathogen of JE is a virus known as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), which penetrates into the CNS from blood and triggers rapid humoral and cell-mediated immune response. Humoral response is crucial for the control of dissemination of JEV infection and the cytokines produced by cell-mediated immunity during JEV infections serve as potent immune mediators. Till date, JE is only vaccine preventable and no complete antiviral treatment is available so far. Further, vaccine-mediated prevention also has certain limitations. Therefore, an understanding of the pathogenesis of JEV infection can enable the researchers to presume the depth of treatment regime. This review highlights the importance of understanding of the immune mechanisms that are operated in the host during JEV infection and would be helpful in improving future vaccination strategy against JEV.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In Japan, however, the active recommendation of JE vaccine was retracted in 2005 because of the potential risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. We aimed to determine the recent incidence of childhood-onset JE after the domestic change of vaccination policy in Japan, and to analyze the clinical features of affected children.A retrospective nationwide survey was conducted for pediatric patients with JE in Japan from 1995 to 2015. The national surveillance system was used to identify the pediatric patients with JE. Follow-up questionnaires were sent to analyze their clinical and neuroimaging profiles.Among a total of 109 patients registered to the national surveillance, 10 (9%) were less than age 15 years. The annual incidence rate of childhood-onset JE was higher during 2005-15 than that during 1995-2004 (4.3 × 10-3 vs 1.1 × 10-3 per 100000, respectively; P = .04). Endemic regions overlapped with prefectures that farmed pigs harboring antibodies against JE virus with high prevalence. Detailed clinical data were collected from 9 patients. None of them died, but 5 of 9 patients (56%) had neurological sequelae after recovery. One patient who was partially vaccinated with 2 doses of JE vaccine fully recovered from a coma. The age of 3 years or less was associated with unfavorable neurological prognosis.Our data provide evidence for the importance and prophylactic effect of the JE vaccine in young children in the endemic area.© The Author(s) 2018.

Here, we identified let-7a and let-7b (let-7a/b) as one of the essential miRNAs over-expressed upon Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) infection and released in the culture supernatant of the JEV-infected microglial cells through extracellular vesicles. The let-7a/b was previously reported to modulate inflammation in microglial cells through Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) pathways; although their role in accelerating JEV pathogenesis remain unexplored. Therefore, we studied the role of let-7a/b in modulating microglia-mediated inflammation during JEV infection and investigated the effect of let-7a/b-containing exosomes on primary neurons. To this end, we examined let-7a/b and NOTCH signaling pathway in TLR7 knockdown (KD) mice. We observed that TLR7 KD or inhibition of let-7a/b suppressed the JEV-induced NOTCH activation possibly via NF-κB dependent manner and subsequently, attenuated JEV-induced TNFα production in microglial cells. Furthermore, exosomes secreted from let-7a/b over-expressed microglia when transferred to uninfected mice brain induced caspase activation. Exosomes secreted from virus-infected or let-7a/b over-expressed microglia when co-incubated with mouse neuronal (Neuro2a) cells or primary cortical neurons also facilitated caspase activation leading to neuronal death. Thus, our results provide evidence for the multifaceted role of let-7a/b miRNAs in JEV pathogenesis. Let-7a/b can interact with TLR7 and NOTCH signaling pathway and enhance TNFα release from microglia. On the other hand, the exosomes secreted by JEV-infected microglia can activate caspases in uninfected neuronal cells which possibly contribute to bystander neuronal death.

Molecular and serological investigations were performed on 123 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from these patients. By neutralization tests and/or virus isolation, four (3.3%) JEV- and one DENV-associated encephalitis cases (0.8%) were confirmed. Antibody titer against JEV Genotype 3 was the highest among the laboratory-confirmed JEV cases. One strain of DENV-1 with Genotype 1 was isolated from the CSF sample of the dengue encephalitis patient; this was similar to the virus circulating in the study area and neighboring countries. This study shows that flaviviruses are important pathogens causing encephalitis in Myanmar. Active disease surveillance, vector control, and vaccination programs should be enforced to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by flavivirus encephalitis."

Information on insecticide resistance in JE vectors is important for the selection of appropriate insecticides for use in vector control. The present study was designed to determine the resistance status of three important vectors of JE, Culex vishnui, Culex tritaeniorhynchus and Culex bitaeniorhynchus (Diptera: Culicidae), against dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), malathion and deltamethrin in three districts of Odisha state affected by JE. Female adult mosquitoes were collected using mouth aspirators both indoors and outdoors in JE-affected villages and used in susceptibility bioassays following World Health Organization guidelines. Knock-downs were recorded every 10 min up to 1 h and mortality rates were recorded at 24 h post-exposure. Culex vishnui and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus showed resistance to DDT, malathion and deltamethrin, whereas Cx. bitaeniorhynchus was susceptible in all study districts.

There are around 68,000 JE cases worldwide each year, many of which result in permanent brain damage and death. There is no specific treatment for JE. Here we present the crystal structure of the JEV capsid protein, a potential drug target, at 1.98 Å, and compare it to other flavivirus capsid proteins. The JEV capsid has a helical secondary structure (α helixes 1-4) and a similar protein fold to the dengue virus (DENV), the West Nile virus (WNV), and the Zika virus (ZIKV) capsid proteins. It forms a homodimer by antiparallel pairing with another subunit (') through α-helix 1-1', 2-2', and 4-4' interactions. This dimeric form is believed to be the building block of the nucleocapsid. The flexibility of the N-terminal α helix-1 allows the formation of closed and open conformations with possible functional importance. The basic C-terminal pairing of α4-4' forms a coiled-coil-like structure, indicating possible nucleic acid binding functionality. However, a comparison with other nucleic acid interacting domains indicates that homodimerization would preclude binding. This is the first JEV capsid protein to be described and is an addition to the structural biology of the Flavivirus."

Japanese encephalitis vaccines: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). MMWR Recomm Rep 2010;59[No. RR-1]). The report summarizes the epidemiology of JE, describes the JE vaccine that is licensed and available in the United States, and provides recommendations for its use among travelers and laboratory workers.JE virus, a mosquitoborne flavivirus, is the most common vaccine-preventable cause of encephalitis in Asia. JE occurs throughout most of Asia and parts of the western Pacific. Approximately 20%-30% of patients die, and 30%-50% of survivors have neurologic, cognitive, or behavioral sequelae. No antiviral treatment is available.Inactivated Vero cell culture-derived JE vaccine (Ixiaro [JE-VC]) is the only JE vaccine that is licensed and available in the United States. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed JE-VC for use in persons aged ≥17 years; in 2013, licensure was extended to include children aged ≥2 months.Most travelers to countries where the disease is endemic are at very low risk for JE. However, some travelers are at increased risk for infection on the basis of their travel plans. Factors that increase the risk for JE virus exposure include 1) traveling for a longer period; 2) travel during the JE virus transmission season; 3) spending time in rural areas; 4) participating in extensive outdoor activities; and 5) staying in accommodations without air conditioning, screens, or bed nets. All travelers to countries where JE is endemic should be advised to take precautions to avoid mosquito bites to reduce the risk for JE and other vectorborne diseases. For some persons who might be at increased risk for JE, the vaccine can further reduce the risk for infection. The decision about whether to vaccinate should be individualized and consider the 1) risks related to the specific travel itinerary, 2) likelihood of future travel to countries where JE is endemic, 3) high morbidity and mortality of JE, 4) availability of an effective vaccine, 5) possibility (but low probability) of serious adverse events after vaccination, and 6) the traveler's personal perception and tolerance of risk.JE vaccine is recommended for persons moving to a JE-endemic country to take up residence, longer-term (e.g., ≥1 month) travelers to JE-endemic areas, and frequent travelers to JE-endemic areas. JE vaccine also should be considered for shorter-term (e.g., <1 month) travelers with an increased risk for JE on the basis of planned travel duration, season, location, activities, and accommodations and for travelers to JE-endemic areas who are uncertain about their specific travel duration, destinations, or activities. JE vaccine is not recommended for travelers with very low-risk itineraries, such as shorter-term travel limited to urban areas or outside of a well-defined JE virus transmission season."

The exact pathophysiology for diverse clinical spectrum of the disease is complex and has not yet been defined. Studies have postulated that during JE infection, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines are produced after the initial recognition of viral antigens through the engagement of toll-like receptors (TLR) pathways. However, there is paucity of knowledge on the expression levels of chemokines and TLRs among mild and severely affected JE patients. Hence, to better understand disease pathogenesis, we examined the mRNA expression of chemokines, CCL2 and CCL5, and their respective receptors CCR2 and CCR5 along with TLRs viz. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 in context of mild and severely Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-infected (n = 19) and healthy (n = 19) individuals. Our study showed significant downregulation of CCL2, CCL5, CCR2, CCR5, and TLR3 by log 0.87, 1.02, 0.82, 0.68, and 0.37-fold respectively, among mild cases compared with controls. Significant difference of gene expression among mild and severe JE cases for CCL2 (p < 0.001), CCL5 (p < 0.01), and TLR7 (p < 0.05) was observed.

CCL2 and CCL5 along with TLR7 may be associated with degree of pathogenesis of JE and could be putative therapeutic targets for preventing severe inflammation during viral encephalitis."

Here we show that JEV activates MCs, leading to the release of granule-associated proteases in vivo. MC-deficient mice display reduced BBB permeability during JEV infection compared to congenic wild-type (WT) mice, indicating that enhanced vascular leakage in the brain during JEV infection is MC-dependent. Moreover, MCs promoted increased JEV infection in the central nervous system (CNS), enhanced neurological deficits, and reduced survival in vivo. Mechanistically, chymase, a MC-specific protease, enhances JEV-induced breakdown of the BBB and cleavage of tight-junction proteins. Chymase inhibition reversed BBB leakage, reduced brain infection and neurological deficits during JEV infection, and prolonged survival, suggesting chymase is a novel therapeutic target to prevent JEV encephalitis."

The PI3K/AKT pathway has been reported to play an important role in type-I interferon response via IRF3. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a negative regulator of PI3K/AKT pathway, participates in microglial polarization and neuroinflammation. The microRNAs are small non-coding endogenously expressed RNAs, which regulate the gene expression by binding at 3' UTR of target gene. The human microglial cells were infected with JEV (JaOArS982 strain) and up-regulation of microRNA; hsa-miR-374b-5p was confirmed by qRT-PCR. The genes in PI3K/AKT pathway, over-expression and knock-down studies of hsa-miR-374b-5p with and without JEV infection were analyzed through immuno blotting. The regulatory role of hsa-miR-374b-5p on the expression of type-I interferon was determined by luciferase assays. JEV infection modulated the expression of hsa-miR-374b-5p and PI3K/AKT pathway via PTEN. The over-expression of hsa-miR-374b-5p suppressed the PTEN while up-regulated the AKT and IRF3 proteins, whereas, the knockdown rescued the PTEN expression and suppressed the AKT and IRF3 proteins. The modulation of hsa-miR-374b-5p regulated the type-I interferon response during JEV infection.

The analysis of data for the period 1994 to 2017 showed that there was a substantial increase of JE cases after the initiation of vaccination in 2006. Since the JE vaccination was given only in selected districts, comparing the vaccinated district with non vaccinated district would be more appropriate to determine the impact of vaccination. However, the data available on JE is only at the state wide.

JEV is transmitted by mosquitoes to a wide range of vertebrate hosts, including birds and mammals. Domestic animals, especially pigs, are generally implicated as reservoirs of the virus, while humans are not part of the natural transmission cycle and cannot pass the virus to other hosts. Although JEV infection is very common in endemic areas (many countries in Asia), less than 1% of people affected develop clinical disease, and severe disease affects about 1 case per 250 JEV infections. Although rare, severe disease can be devastating; among the 30,000-50,000 global cases per year, approximately 20-30% of patients die and 30-50% of survivors develop significant neurological sequelae. JE is a significant public health problem for residents in endemic areas and may constitute a substantial risk for travelers to these areas. The epidemiology of JE and its risk to travelers have changed, and continue to evolve. The rapid economic growth of Asian countries has led to a surge in both inbound and outbound travel, making Asia the second most-visited region in the world after Europe, with 279 million international travelers in 2015. The top destination is China, followed by Thailand, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Japan, and the number of travelers is forecast to reach 535 million by 2030 (+ 4.9% per year). Because of the lack of treatment and the infeasibility of eliminating the vector, vaccination is recognized as the most efficacious means of preventing JE. The IC51 vaccine (IXIARO®) is a purified, inactivated, whole virus vaccine against JE. It is safe, well tolerated, efficacious and can be administered to children, adults and the elderly. The vaccination schedule involves administering 2 doses four weeks apart. For adults, a rapid schedule (0-7 days) is available, which could greatly enhance the feasibility of its use. Healthcare workers should inform both short- and long-term travelers of the risk of JE in each period of the year and recommend vaccination. Indeed, it has been shown that short-term travelers are also at risk, not only in rural environments, but also in cities and coastal towns, especially in tourist localities where excursions to country areas are organized."

However, whether this happens in composited brain remains unclear. Human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived organoids can model disorders caused by human endemic pathogens such as Zika virus, which may potentially address this question and facilitate the discovery of a cure for JE. We thus generated telencephalon organoid and infected them with JEV. We found JEV infection caused significant decline of cell proliferation and increase of cell death in brain organoid, resulting in smaller organoid spheres. JEV tended to infect astrocytes and neural progenitors, especially the population representing outer radial glial cells (oRGCs) of developing human brain. In addition, we revealed variable antiviral immunity in brain organoids of different stages of culture. In organoids of longer culture (older than 8 weeks), but not of early ones (less than 4 weeks), JEV infection caused typical activation of interferon signaling pathway. Preferential infection of oRGCs and differential antiviral response at various stages might explain the much more severe outcomes of JEV infection in the younger, which also provide clues to develop effective therapeutics of such diseases."

Integration analysis of in vitro and in vivo mRNA transcriptome revealed that JEV infection regulated apoptosis-related Foxo signaling pathway. Foxo expression was reduced by JEV infection in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of Foxo promoted apoptosis, while its overexpression reduced apoptosis in JEV-infected Neuro-2a cells. JEV infection in Neuro-2a cells decreased the expression of Foxo downstream genes including pro-apoptotic protein Bim, anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-6 and p21. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-6 and p21 repressed JEV-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that Foxo primarily exerts an anti-apoptotic function via Bcl-6 and p21 in JEV-infected Neuro-2a cells. A STAT3 binding site was identified in the promoter region of Foxo by TFBIND software and confirmed by ChIP and reporter assays. JEV infection reduced STAT3 expression as well as its binding at the Foxo promoter compared to mock infection in Neuro-2a cells. Moreover, STAT3 knockdown reduced Foxo promoter activity and Foxo expression. Therefore, JEV reduced Foxo expression, at least in part, by downregulating STAT3.

In this study, we assessed whether amino acid substitutions are critical factors for higher mortality of JaTH160 compared with JaOArS982 in mice using the technique of infectious cDNA clones. We raised the possibility that two amino acids of C124 and NS3482 of JaTH160 may contribute to increased mortality in mice. However, simultaneous substitutions of these amino acids did not significantly increase the virulence of JaOArS982, suggesting that high mortality due to JaTH160 viral infection cannot be simply attributed to the specific amino acids. Multiple and complex, but not simple, mechanisms may induce the high mortality of JaTH160 infection in mice."

NS1', a 52-amino acid C-terminal extension of NS1, is generated with a -1 programmed ribosomal frameshift and is only present in members of the Japanese encephalitis serogroup of flaviviruses. Previous studies demonstrated that NS1' plays a vital role in virulence, but the mechanism is unclear. In this study, an NS1' defected (rG66A) virus was generated. We found that rG66A virus was less virulent than its parent virus (pSA14) in wild-type mice. However, similar mortality caused by the two viruses was observed in an IFNAR knockout mouse model. Moreover, we found that rG66A virus induced a greater type I interferon (IFN) response than that by pSA14, and JEV NS1' significantly inhibited the production of IFN-β and IFN-stimulated genes. Taken together, our results reveal that NS1' plays a vital role in blocking type I IFN production to help JEV evade antiviral immunity and benefit viral replication."

Both DENV and JE-V belong to the genus Flavivirus. Climatic changes, food imports from the tropics and travel behavior have also increased the number of cases of diseases caused by tropical or subtropical viruses in Europe. Due to the close degree of relationship of the flaviviruses, coinfections with several arboviruses can occur. The DENV and JE-V are mosquito-borne infections caused by the genus Aedes spp. In cases of involvement of the central nervous system, the virus often reaches the brain via the blood-brain barrier. The DENV is a single-stranded RNA-positive virus with four known serotypes, DENV-1 to DENV-4. The DENV infections are usually asymptomatic and are known as classical dengue fever, the more severe courses are dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS), usually with fatal outcome. Both DHF and DSS are classical second infections. A vaccination is not approved in Germany but has been approved for endemic regions since 2015. The course of an infection with JE-V initially runs characteristically and it is only characterized by encephalitis a few days later. For the JE-V a vaccine is approved even in Germany."

At present, there are no specific drugs or therapies for JEV infection, which can only be treated symptomatically. Lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) is a highly efficient method to silence target genes. In this study, two lentiviral shRNA, LV-C and LV-NS5, targeting the conserved viral gene sequences were used to inhibit different JEV genotypes strains in BHK21 cells and mice. The results showed that LV-C significantly inhibited JEV genotype I and genotype III strains in cells and mice. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that JEV mRNA were reduced by 83.2-90.9% in cells by LV-C and that flow cytometry analysis confirmed the inhibitory activity of LV-C. The viral titers were reduced by about 1000-fold in cells and the brains of suckling mice by LV-C, and the pretreatment of LV-C protected 60-80% of mice against JEV-induced lethality. The inhibitory activities of LV-NS5 in cells and mice were weaker than those of LV-C. These results indicate that RNAi targeting of the two conserved viral gene sequences had significantly suppressed the replication of different JEV genotypes strains in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the feasibility of RNAi targeting of conserved viral gene sequences for controlling JEV infection."

World Health Organization recognized Japanese Encephalitis (JE) as a public health priority in demands to initiate active vaccination programs. Recently, the geographic distribution of JEV has apparently expanded into other areas in the Pacific islands and northern Australia; however, major gaps exist in knowledge in regard to its current distribution. Here, we mapped the potential distribution of mosquito vectors of JEV (Culex tritaeniorhynchus, Cx. pseudovishnui, Cx. vishnui, Cx. fuscocephala, Cx. gelidus), and reservoirs (Egretta garzetta, E. intermedia, Nycticorax nycticorax) based on ecological niche modeling approach. Ecological niche models predicted all species to occur across Central, South and South East Asia; however, Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, E. garzetta, E. intermedia, and N. nycticorax had broader potential distributions extending west to parts of the Arabian Peninsula. All predictions were robust and significantly better than random (P < 0.001). We also tested the JEV prediction based on 4335 additional independent human case records collected by the Chinese Information System for Disease Control and Prevention (CISDCP); 4075 cases were successfully predicted by the model (P < 0.001). Finally, we tested the ecological niche similarity among JEV, vector, and reservoir species and could not reject any of the null hypotheses of niche similarity in all combination pairs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of NMDAR in the regulation of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-mediated neuropathogenesis remains undisclosed. The primary objective of this study was to understand the function of NMDAR to JEV-induced neuronal cell damage and inflammation in the central nervous system.The effect of JEV-induced NMDAR activation on the progression of Japanese encephalitis was evaluated using the primary mouse neuron/glia cultures and a mouse model of JEV infection. A high-affinity NMDAR antagonist MK-801 was employed to block the activity of NMDAR both in vitro and in vivo. The subsequent impact of NMDAR blockade was assessed by examining the neuronal cell death, glutamate and inflammatory cytokine production, and JEV-induced mice mortality.JEV infection enhanced the activity of NMDAR which eventually led to increased neuronal cell damage. The data obtained from our in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that NMDAR blockade significantly abrogated the neuronal cell death and inflammatory response triggered by JEV infection. Moreover, administration of NMDAR antagonist protected the mice from JEV-induced lethality.NMDAR plays an imperative role in regulating the JEV-induced neuronal cell damage and neuroinflammation. Thus, NMDAR targeting may constitute a captivating approach to rein in Japanese encephalitis."

However, the exact mechanisms of injury to the central nervous system (CNS) during flavivirus infections remain poorly understood. Microglia are the resident immune cells of the CNS and are important for multiple functions, including control of viral pathogenesis. Utilizing a pharmacologic method of microglia depletion (PLX5622 [Plexxikon Inc.], an inhibitor of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor), we sought to determine the role of microglia in flaviviral pathogenesis. Depletion of microglia resulted in increased mortality and viral titer in the brain following infection with either West Nile virus (WNV) or Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). Interestingly, microglial depletion did not prevent virus-induced increases in the expression of relevant cytokines and chemokines at the mRNA level. In fact, the expression of several proinflammatory genes was increased in virus-infected, microglia-depleted mice compared to virus-infected, untreated controls. In contrast, and as expected, expression of the macrophage marker triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) was decreased in virus-infected, PLX5622-treated mice compared to virus-infected controls.IMPORTANCE As CNS invasion by flaviviruses is a rare but life-threatening event, it is critical to understand how brain-resident immune cells elicit protection or injury during disease progression. Microglia have been shown to be important in viral clearance but may also contribute to CNS injury as part of the neuroinflammatory process. By utilizing a microglial depletion model, we can begin to parse out the exact roles of microglia during flaviviral pathogenesis with hopes of understanding specific mechanisms as potential targets for therapeutics.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology."

Not much is known about the interactions between viral and cellular factors that regulate JEV infection. By using a kinase/phosphatase-wide RNAi screening approach, we identified a cell cycle-regulating molecule, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), that plays a role in regulating JEV replication. JEV infection induced G1 arrest and activated CHK2. Inactivation of CHK2 and its upstream ataxia-telangiectasia mutated kinase in JEV-infected cells by using inhibitors reduced virus replication. Likewise, JEV replication was significantly decreased by knockdown of CHK2 expression with shRNA-producing lentiviral transduction. We identified CHK2 as a cellular factor participating in JEV replication, for a new strategy in addressing JEV infection."
