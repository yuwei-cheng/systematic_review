"Infectious Disease Hospitalizations, New York City, 2001-2014.","10.1177/0033354920935080","2020 Sep/Oct","32687737","Hospital discharge data are a means of monitoring infectious diseases in a population. We investigated rates of infectious disease hospitalizations in New York City.We analyzed data for residents discharged from New York State hospitals with a principal diagnosis of an infectious disease during 2001-2014 by using the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System. We calculated annual age-adjusted hospitalization rates and the percentage of hospitalizations in which in-hospital death occurred. We examined diagnoses by site of infection or sepsis and by pathogen type.During 2001-2014, the mean annual age-adjusted rate of infectious disease hospitalizations in New York City was 1661.6 (95% CI, 1659.2-1663.9) per 100 000 population; the mean annual age-adjusted hospitalization rate decreased from 2001-2003 to 2012-2014 (rate ratio = 0.9; 95% CI, 0.9-0.9). The percentage of in-hospital death during 2001-2014 was 5.9%. The diagnoses with the highest mean annual age-adjusted hospitalization rates among all sites of infection and sepsis diagnoses were the lower respiratory tract, followed by sepsis. From 2001-2003 to 2012-2014, the mean annual age-adjusted hospitalization rate per 100 000 population for HIV decreased from 123.1 (95% CI, 121.7-124.5) to 40.0 (95% CI, 39.2-40.7) and for tuberculosis decreased from 10.2 (95% CI, 9.8-10.6) to 4.6 (95% CI, 4.4-4.9).Although hospital discharge data are subject to limitations, particularly for tracking sepsis, lower respiratory tract infections and sepsis are important causes of infectious disease hospitalizations in New York City. Hospitalizations for HIV infection and tuberculosis appear to be declining."
"Things must not fall apart: the ripple effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on children in sub-Saharan Africa.","10.1038/s41390-020-01174-y","2020 Sep 24","32971527","Zero to 19 year-old children in sub-Saharan Africa bear a disproportionate proportion of the global burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases. Significant public health gains have been made in the fight against these diseases, however, factors such as underequipped health systems, disease outbreaks, conflict, and political instability continue to challenge prevention and control. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) introduces new challenges to public health programs in sub-Saharan Africa. Of particular concern are programs targeting major conditions among children, such as undernutrition, vaccine-preventable pneumonia and diarrhea, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and sickle cell disease. This article focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on child health in sub-Saharan Africa. We review the epidemiology of major pediatric diseases and, referencing modeling projections, discuss the short- and long-term impact of the pandemic on major disease control. We deliberate on potential complications of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections/co-morbidities and identify critical social and ethical issues. Furthermore, we highlight the paucity of COVID-19 data and clinical trials in this region and the lack of child participants in ongoing studies. Lastly, approaches and interventions to mitigate the pandemic's impact on child health outcomes are discussed. IMPACT: Children in sub-Saharan Africa bear a disproportionate burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases globally; this remains true even as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. Amidst the fast-expanding COVID-19 literature, there is little comprehensive coverage of the pandemic's indirect impact on child health in sub-Saharan Africa. This article comprehensively outlines the threat that the pandemic poses to major disease prevention and control for children in sub-Saharan Africa. It discusses the potential impact of SARS-CoV-2 co-infections/co-morbidities, highlights research gaps, and advocates for data and action to mitigate the ripple effects of the pandemic on this population."
"Containment of COVID-19 in Ethiopia and implications for tuberculosis care and research.","10.1186/s40249-020-00753-9","2020 Sep 16","32938497","The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has emerged as a global health and economic security threat with staggering cumulative incidence worldwide. Given the severity of projections, hospitals across the globe are creating additional critical care surge capacity and limiting patient routine access to care for other diseases like tuberculosis (TB). The outbreak fuels panic in sub-Saharan Africa where the healthcare system is fragile in withstanding the disease. Here, we looked over the COVID-19 containment measures in Ethiopia in context from reliable sources and put forth recommendations that leverage the health system response to COVID-19 and TB.Ethiopia shares a major proportion of the global burden of infectious diseases, while the patterns of COVID-19 are still at an earlier stage of the epidemiology curve. The Ethiopian government exerted tremendous efforts to curb the disease. It limited public gatherings, ordered school closures, directed high-risk civil servants to work from home, and closed borders. It suspended flights to 120 countries and restricted mass transports. It declared a five-month national state of emergency and granted a pardon for 20 402 prisoners. It officially postponed parliamentary and presidential elections. It launched the 'PM Abiy-Jack Ma initiative', which supports African countries with COVID-19 diagnostics and infection prevention and control commodities. It expanded its COVID-19 testing capacity to 38 countrywide laboratories. Many institutions are made available to provide clinical care and quarantine. However, the outbreak still has the potential for greater loss of life in Ethiopia if the community is unable to shape the regular behavioral and sociocultural norms that would facilitate the spread of the disease. The government needs to keep cautious that irregular migrants would fuel the disease. A robust testing capacity is needed to figure out the actual status of the disease. The pandemic has reduced TB care and research activities significantly and these need due attention.Ethiopia took several steps to detect, manage, and control COVID-19. More efforts are needed to increase testing capacity and bring about behavioral changes in the community. The country needs to put in place alternative options to mitigate interruptions of essential healthcare services and scientific researches of significant impact."
"Confronting structural racism in the prevention and control of tuberculosis in the United States.","10.1093/cid/ciaa1763","2020 Nov 26","33242078","Tuberculosis incidence in the United States is declining, yet projections indicate that we will not eliminate tuberculosis in the 21 st century. Incidence rates in regions serving the rural and urban poor, including recent immigrants, are well above the national average. People experiencing incarceration and homelessness represent additional key populations. Better engagement of marginalized populations will not succeed without first addressing the structural racism that fuels continued transmission. Examples include: (1) systematic underfunding of contact tracing in health departments serving regions where Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) live; (2) poor access to affordable care in state governments that refuse to expand insurance coverage to low-income workers through the Affordable Care Act; (3) disproportionate incarceration of BIPOC into crowded prisons with low tuberculosis screening rates; and (4) fear-mongering among immigrants that discourages them from accessing preventive health services. To eliminate tuberculosis, we must first eliminate racist policies that limit essential health services in vulnerable communities.© The Author(s) 2020.

"Ten-year survival with analysis of gender difference, risk factors, and causes of death during 13 years of public antiretroviral therapy in rural Kenya.","10.1097/MD.0000000000020328","2020 May 22","32481319","Evidence for why antiretroviral therapy (ART) outcomes differ by gender in developing countries has been inconclusive. In this first study to assess 10-year survival on ART in Kenya, our objective was to compare gender differences in survival for those who began ART as adults and as children. Kakamega County Referral Hospital (KCRH) is a tertiary rural hospital that has provided public ART to Kenyans since 2004. All patients enrolled in ART at KCRH who died between July 2004 and March 2017 and a sample of living patients were included in a survival analysis that bootstrapped sampled data. Case-cohort regressions identified adjusted hazard ratios. In total, 1360 patients were included in the study. Ten-year survival was 77% (95% confidence band [CB] 73-81%), significantly different for men (65%; 95% CB: 45-74%) and women (83%; 95% CB: 78-86%) who began therapy as adults. Ten-year survival was intermediate with no significant gender difference (76%; 95% CB: 69-81%) for patients who began therapy as children. Hazard of death was increased for men (hazard ratio [HR] 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13-2.17), infants (HR 2.87; 95% CI 1.44-5.74), patients with consistently poor clinic attendance (HR 3.94; 95% CI 3.19-4.86), and divorced patients (HR 2.25; 95% CI 1.19-4.25). Tuberculosis, diarrheal illnesses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) wasting syndrome, and malaria were leading causes of death. Survival was significantly lower for men than for women in all time periods, but only for patients who began therapy as adults, indicating against biological etiologies for the gender mortality difference."
"Tuberculosis infection and epidemiological characteristics in Haidian District, Beijing, 2005-2018.","10.1186/s12889-020-08773-8","2020 Jun 1","32487108","This study was aimed to investigate the epidemiological characteristic of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in Haidian District, Beijing from 2005 to 2018 and to provide suggestions for controlling tuberculosis (TB) development.Epidemiological data about TB were obtained by the Infectious Disease Reporting System at different levels of medical institutions in Haidian District of Beijing from 2005 to 2018. The epidemiological methods combined with χ2 test were used to analyze the distribution of TB in population, time, region and TB diagnosis.In total, 14,449 cases of TB patients were reported in Haidian District from 2005 to 2018 and the average annual morbidity was 31.67/10,000. Of the total cases, housework and unemployed people (20.73%; 2996/14,449) accounted for the highest proportion of occupational distribution, followed by students, accounting for 17.18% (2482/14,449). 2433 patients with the age of 65 years and over accounting for 16.83% (2433/14,449); Laboratory confirmed diagnosis of TB was 26.60% and the diagnostic delays accounted for 54.96%.From 2005 to 2018, TB incidence was falling gradually in Haidian District. However, particular attention should be paid to the elderly and student groups, and the policy publicity and education should be strengthened to reduce the diagnosis delay of TB."
"Forecasting tuberculosis using diabetes-related google trends data.","10.1080/20477724.2020.1767854","2020 Jul","32453658","Online activity-based data can be used to aid infectious disease forecasting. Our aim was to exploit the converging nature of the tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes epidemics to forecast TB case numbers. Thus, we extended TB prediction models based on traditional data with diabetes-related Google searches. We obtained data on the weekly case numbers of TB in Germany from June 8th, 2014, to May 5th, 2019. Internet search data were obtained from a Google Trends (GTD) search for 'diabetes' to the corresponding interval. A seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA) model (0,1,1) (1,0,0) [52] was selected to describe the weekly TB case numbers with and without GTD as an external regressor. We cross-validated the SARIMA models to obtain the root mean squared errors (RMSE). We repeated this procedure with autoregressive feed-forward neural network (NNAR) models using 5-fold cross-validation. To simulate a data-poor surveillance setting, we also tested traditional and GTD-extended models against a hold-out dataset using a decreased 52-week-long period with missing values for training. Cross-validation resulted in an RMSE of 20.83 for the traditional model and 18.56 for the GTD-extended model. Cross-validation of the NNAR models showed a mean RMSE of 19.49 for the traditional model and 18.99 for the GTD-extended model. When we tested the models trained on a decreased dataset with missing values, the GTD-extended models achieved significantly better prediction than the traditional models (p < 0.001). The GTD-extended models outperformed the traditional models in all assessed model evaluation parameters. Using online activity-based data regarding diabetes can improve TB forecasting, but further validation is warranted."
"Etiology and characteristics of patients with bronchiectasis in Taiwan: a cohort study from 2002 to 2016.","10.1186/s12890-020-1080-7","2020 Feb 18","32070324","Bronchiectasis is a chronic infectious respiratory disease with diverse causes and ethnic or geographic differences. However, few large-scale studies of its etiology have been conducted in Asia. This study aimed to determine the etiology and clinical features of bronchiectasis in Taiwan.This longitudinal cohort study investigated the etiology and clinical features of newly diagnosed non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis patients from January 2002 to December 2016. The clinical, functional and microbiological data of patients were retrieved from the Chang Gung Research Database, which includes seven medical facilities throughout Taiwan. The index date was the date of the first bronchiectasis diagnosis. Known diseases that were diagnosed before the index date were regarded as etiologies of bronchiectasis.The cohort comprised 15,729 adult patients with bronchiectasis. Idiopathic (32%) was the most common cause, followed by post-pneumonia (24%). Other causes included post-tuberculosis (12%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (14%), asthma (10%), gastroesophageal reflux disease (2%) and rheumatic diseases (2%). At diagnosis, 8487 patients had sputum culture. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.3%) was the most common bacteria, followed by non-tuberculosis mycobacteria (3.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (3.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.1%), but 6155 (72.1%) had negative sputum cultures. Patients with post-tuberculosis had a higher sputum isolation rate of non-tuberculosis mycobacteria than P. aeruginosa. Patients with post-tuberculosis and post-pneumonia bronchiectasis had a higher frequency of chronic lung infection than other groups (p < 0.05). Clinical characteristics, such as gender, lung function, comorbidities and microbiology, were significantly different between idiopathic and known etiologies.Idiopathic, post-infection and tuberculosis constitute major bronchiectasis etiologies in Taiwan. Clinical characteristics and sputum microbiology were distinct among separate etiology phenotypes."
"Comparative Modeling of Tuberculosis Epidemiology and Policy Outcomes in California.","10.1164/rccm.201907-1289OC","2020 Feb 1","31626560","Rationale: Mathematical modeling is used to understand disease dynamics, forecast trends, and inform public health prioritization. We conducted a comparative analysis of tuberculosis (TB) epidemiology and potential intervention effects in California, using three previously developed epidemiologic models of TB.Objectives: To compare the influence of various modeling methods and assumptions on epidemiologic projections of domestic latent TB infection (LTBI) control interventions in California.Methods: We compared model results between 2005 and 2050 under a base-case scenario representing current TB services and alternative scenarios including: 1) sustained interruption of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission, 2) sustained resolution of LTBI and TB prior to entry of new residents, and 3) one-time targeted testing and treatment of LTBI among 25% of non-U.S.-born individuals residing in California.Measurements and Main Results: Model estimates of TB cases and deaths in California were in close agreement over the historical period but diverged for LTBI prevalence and new Mtb infections-outcomes for which definitive data are unavailable. Between 2018 and 2050, models projected average annual declines of 0.58-1.42% in TB cases, without additional interventions. A one-time LTBI testing and treatment intervention among non-U.S.-born residents was projected to produce sustained reductions in TB incidence. Models found prevalent Mtb infection and migration to be more significant drivers of future TB incidence than local transmission.Conclusions: All models projected a stagnation in the decline of TB incidence, highlighting the need for additional interventions including greater access to LTBI diagnosis and treatment for non-U.S.-born individuals. Differences in model results reflect gaps in historical data and uncertainty in the trends of key parameters, demonstrating the need for high-quality, up-to-date data on TB determinants and outcomes."
"Evaluation of 6-Month Versus Continuous Isoniazid Preventive Therapy for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Adults Living With HIV/AIDS in Malawi.","10.1097/QAI.0000000000002497","2020 Dec 15","33177475","To assist the Malawi Ministry of Health to evaluate 2 competing strategies for scale-up of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among HIV-positive adults receiving antiretroviral therapy.Malawi.We used a multidistrict, compartmental model of the Malawi tuberculosis (TB)/HIV epidemic to compare the anticipated health impacts of 6-month versus continuous IPT programs over a 12-year horizon while respecting a US$10.8 million constraint on drug costs in the first 3 years.The 6-month IPT program could be implemented nationwide, whereas the continuous IPT alternative could be introduced in 14 (of the 27) districts. By the end of year 12, the continuous IPT strategy was predicted to avert more TB cases than the 6-month alternative, although not statistically significant (2368 additional cases averted; 95% projection interval [PI], -1459 to 5023). The 6-month strategy required fewer person-years of IPT to avert a case of TB or death than the continuous strategy. For both programs, the mean reductions in TB incidence among people living with HIV by year 12 were expected to be <10%, and the cumulative numbers of IPT-related hepatotoxicity to exceed the number of all-cause deaths averted in the first 3 years.With the given budgetary constraint, the nationwide implementation of 6-month IPT would be more efficient and yield comparable health benefits than implementing a continuous IPT program in fewer districts. The anticipated health effects associated with both IPT strategies suggested that a combination of different TB intervention strategies would likely be required to yield a greater impact on TB control in settings such as Malawi, where antiretroviral therapycoverage is relatively high."
"Spatiotemporal characteristics and the epidemiology of tuberculosis in China from 2004 to 2017 by the nationwide surveillance system.","10.1186/s12889-020-09331-y","2020 Aug 26","32843011","China has always been one of the countries with the most serious Tuberculosis epidemic in the world. Our study was to observe the Spatial-temporal characteristics and the epidemiology of Tuberculosis in China from 2004 to 2017 with Joinpoint regression analysis, Seasonal Autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, geographic cluster, and multivariate time series model.The data of TB from January 2004 to December 2017 were obtained from the notifiable infectious disease reporting system supplied by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The incidence trend of TB was observed by the Joinpoint regression analysis. The Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model was used to predict the monthly incidence. Geographic clusters was employed to analyze the spatial autocorrelation. The relative importance component of TB was detected by the multivariate time series model.We included 13,991,850 TB cases from January 2004 to December 2017, with a yearly average morbidity of 999,417 cases. The final selected model was the 0 Joinpoint model (P = 0.0001) with an annual average percent change (AAPC) of - 3.3 (95% CI: - 4.3 to - 2.2, P < 0.001). A seasonality was observed across the 14 years, and the seasonal peaks were in January and March every year. The best SARIMA model was (0, 1, 1) X (0, 1, 1)12 which can be written as (1-B) (1-B12) Xt = (1-0.42349B) (1-0.43338B12) εt, with a minimum AIC (880.5) and SBC (886.4). The predicted value and the original incidence data of 2017 were well matched. The MSE, RMSE, MAE, and MAPE of the modelling performance were 201.76, 14.2, 8.4 and 0.06, respectively. The provinces with a high incidence were located in the northwest (Xinjiang, Tibet) and south (Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan) of China. The hotspot of TB transmission was mainly located at southern region of China from 2004 to 2008, including Hainan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Chongqing, which disappeared in the later years. The autoregressive component had a leading role in the incidence of TB which accounted for 81.5-84.5% of the patients on average. The endemic component was about twice as large in the western provinces as the average while the spatial-temporal component was less important there. Most of the high incidences (> 70 cases per 100,000) were influenced by the autoregressive component for the past 14 years.In a word, China still has a high TB incidence. However, the incidence rate of TB was significantly decreasing from 2004 to 2017 in China. Seasonal peaks were in January and March every year. Obvious geographical clusters were observed in Tibet and Xinjiang Province. The relative importance component of TB driving transmission was distinguished from the multivariate time series model. For every provinces over the past 14 years, the autoregressive component played a leading role in the incidence of TB which need us to enhance the early protective implementation."
"Estimating Disability-Adjusted Life Years due to Tuberculosis in Korea through to the Year 2040.","10.3390/ijerph17165960","2020 Aug 17","32824613","Despite efforts to reduce its incidence, tuberculosis continues to burden the rapidly aging Korean society. This study aimed to investigate the current trend of tuberculosis burden in Korea and its projections to 2040. We used National Health Insurance claims data to calculate the disability-adjusted life years due to tuberculosis in Korea. Disability-adjusted life years were measured by summing the years of life lost and the years lived with disability using an incidence-based approach. We modeled the incidence rates using a time-series model for the projection of disability-adjusted life years accrued from 2020 to 2040. The total disability-adjusted life years due to tuberculosis were 69, 64, 59, and 49 disability-adjusted life years/100,000 population in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. In both sexes, disability-adjusted life years were the highest in those aged ≥80 years. Projected disability-adjusted life years showed a descending trend from 38 disability-adjusted life years/100,000 in 2020, to 14 disability-adjusted life years/100,000 in 2040. Conversely, the projected disability-adjusted life years increased among females aged ≥80 years. Although the tuberculosis burden in Korea is decreasing, a high burden remains among the elderly. Therefore, interventions targeting those vulnerable are required."
"Statistical methods for predicting tuberculosis incidence based on data from Guangxi, China.","10.1186/s12879-020-05033-3","2020 Apr 22","32321419","Tuberculosis (TB) remains a serious public health problem with substantial financial burden in China. The incidence of TB in Guangxi province is much higher than that in the national level, however, there is no predictive study of TB in recent years in Guangxi, therefore, it is urgent to construct a model to predict the incidence of TB, which could provide help for the prevention and control of TB.Box-Jenkins model methods have been successfully applied to predict the incidence of infectious disease. In this study, based on the analysis of TB incidence in Guangxi from January 2012 to June 2019, we constructed TB prediction model by Box-Jenkins methods, and used root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) to test the performance and prediction accuracy of model.From January 2012 to June 2019, a total of 587,344 cases of TB were reported and 879 cases died in Guangxi. Based on TB incidence from January 2012 to December 2018, the SARIMA((2),0,(2))(0,1,0)12 model was established, the AIC and SC of this model were 2.87 and 2.98, the fitting accuracy indexes, such as RMSE, MAE and MAPE were 0.98, 0.77 and 5.8 respectively; the prediction accuracy indexes, such as RMSE, MAE and MAPE were 0.62, 0.45 and 3.77, respectively. Based on the SARIMA((2),0,(2))(0,1,0)12 model, we predicted the TB incidence in Guangxi from July 2019 to December 2020.This study filled the gap in the prediction of TB incidence in Guangxi in recent years. The established SARIMA((2),0,(2))(0,1,0)12 model has high prediction accuracy and good prediction performance. The results suggested the change trend of TB incidence predicted by SARIMA((2),0,(2))(0,1,0)12 model from July 2019 to December 2020 was similar to that in the previous two years, and TB incidence will experience slight decrease, the predicted results can provide scientific reference for the prevention and control of TB in Guangxi, China."
"COVID-19 and tuberculosis: A mathematical model based forecasting in Delhi, India.","10.1016/j.ijtb.2020.05.006","2020 Apr","32553309","There is emerging evidence that patients with Latent Tuberculosis Infection(LTBI) and Tuberculosis(TB) disease have an increased risk of the SARS-CoV-2 infection and predisposition towards developing severe COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study we attempted to estimate the number of TB patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have severe disease during the COVID-19 epidemic in Delhi, India.Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was used to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases in Delhi. Assuming the prevalence of TB in Delhi to be 0.55%, 53% of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases to present with severe disease we estimated the number of SARS-CoV2 infected TB cases and the number of severe patients. The modelling used estimated R0 for two scenarios, without any intervention and with public health interventions.We observed that the peak of SARS-CoV-2-TB co-infected patients would occur on the 94th day in absence of public health interventions and on 138th day in presence of interventions. There could be 20,880 SARS-CoV-2 infected TB cases on peak day of epidemic when interventions are implemented and 27,968 cases in the absence of intervention. Among them, there could be 14,823 patients with severe disease when no interventions are implemented and 11,066 patients with severe disease in the presence of intervention.The importance of primary prevention measures needs to be emphasized especially in TB patients. The TB treatment centres and hospitals needs to be prepared for early diagnosis and management of severe COVID-19 in TB patients.Copyright © 2020 Tuberculosis Association of India.

"Individualized Dosing With High Inter-Occasion Variability Is Correctly Handled With Model-Informed Precision Dosing-Using Rifampicin as an Example.","10.3389/fphar.2020.00794","2020","32536870","Rifampicin exhibits complexities in its pharmacokinetics (PK), including high inter-occasion variability (IOV), which is challenging for dose individualization. Model-informed precision dosing (MIPD) can be used to optimize individual doses. In this simulation-based study we investigated the magnitude of IOV in rifampicin PK on an exposure level, the impact of not acknowledging IOV when performing MIPD, and the number of sampling occasions needed to forecast the dose. Subjects with drug-susceptible tuberculosis (TB) were simulated from a previously developed population PK model. To explore the magnitude of IOV, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero up to 24 h (AUC0-24h) after 35 mg/kg in the typical individual was simulated for 1,000 sampling occasions at steady-state. The impact of ignoring IOV for dose predictions was investigated by comparing the prediction error of a MIPD approach including IOV to an approach ignoring IOV. Furthermore, the number of sampling occasions needed to predict individual doses using a MIPD approach was assessed. The AUC0-24h in the typical individual varied substantially between simulated sampling occasions [95% prediction interval (PI): 122.2 to 331.2 h mg/L], equivalent to an IOV in AUC0-24h of 25.8%, compared to an inter-individual variability of 25.4%. The median of the individual prediction errors using a MIPD approach incorporating IOV was 0% (75% PI: -14.6% to 0.0%), and the PI for the individual prediction errors was narrower with than without IOV (median: 0%, 75% PI: -14.6% to 20.0%). The most common target dose in this population was forecasted correctly in 95% of the subjects when IOV was included in MIPD. In subjects where doses were not predicted optimally, a lower dose was predicted compared to the target, which is favorable from a safety perspective. Moreover, the imprecision (relative root mean square error) and bias in predicted doses using MIPD with IOV decreased statistically significant when a second sampling occasion was added (difference in imprecision: -9.1%, bias: -7.7%), but only marginally including a third (difference in imprecision: -0.1%, bias: -0.1%). In conclusion, a large variability in exposure of rifampicin between occasions was shown. In order to forecast the individual dose correctly, IOV must be acknowledged which can be achieved using a MIPD approach with PK information from at least two sampling occasions.Copyright © 2020 Keutzer and Simonsson."
"An Advanced Data-Driven Hybrid Model of SARIMA-NNNAR for Tuberculosis Incidence Time Series Forecasting in Qinghai Province, China.","10.2147/IDR.S232854","2020","32273731","Qinghai province has invariably been under an ongoing threat of tuberculosis (TB), which has not only been an obstacle to local development but also hampers the prevention and control process for ending the TB epidemic. Forecasting for future epidemics will serve as the base for early detection and planning resource requirements. Here, we aim to develop an advanced detection technique driven by the recent TB incidence series, by fusing a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) with a neural network nonlinear autoregression (NNNAR).We collected the TB incidence data between January 2004 and December 2016. Subsequently, the subsamples from January 2004 to December 2015 were employed to measure the efficiency of the single SARIMA, NNNAR, and hybrid SARIMA-NNNAR approaches, whereas the hold-out subsamples were used to test their predictive performances. We finally selected the best-performing technique by considering minimum metrics including the mean absolute error, root-mean-squared error, mean absolute percentage error and mean error rate .During 2004-2016, the reported TB cases totaled 71,080 resulting in the morbidity of 97.624 per 100,000 persons annually in Qinghai province and showed notable peak activities in late winter and early spring. Moreover, the TB incidence rate was surging by 5% per year. According to the above-mentioned criteria, the best-fitting basic and hybrid techniques consisted of SARIMA(2,0,2)(1,1,0)12, NNNAR(7,1,4)12 and SARIMA(2,0,2)(1,1,0)12-NNNAR(3,1,7)12, respectively. Amongst them, the hybrid technique showed superiority in both mimic and predictive parts, with the lowest values of the measured metrics in both the parts. The sensitivity analysis indicated the same results.The best-mimicking SARIMA-NNNAR hybrid model outperforms the best-simulating basic SARIMA and NNNAR models, and has a potential application in forecasting and assessing the TB epidemic trends in Qinghai. Furthermore, faced with the major challenge of the ongoing upsurge in TB incidence in Qinghai, there is an urgent need for formulating specific preventive and control measures.© 2020 Wang et al."
"Ending TB in Southeast Asia: current resources are not enough.","10.1136/bmjgh-2019-002073","2020","32201625","The Southeast Asia Region continues to battle tuberculosis (TB) as one of its most severe health and development challenges. Unless there is a substantial increase in investments for TB prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment, there will be catastrophic effects for the region. The uncontrolled TB burden impacts socioeconomic development and increase of drug resistance in the region. Based on epidemiological inputs from a mathematical model, a costing analysis estimates that the desired targets of ending TB are achievable with additional interventions, and critical thresholds require an increase in spending by almost double the current levels. The data source for financial allocation to TB programmes is the report submitted by countries to WHO, while projections are based on modelling. The model accounts for funding needs for all strategies based on published data and accounts for programme and patient costs. This paper delineates the resource needs, availability and gaps of ending TB in the region. It is estimated that close to US$2 billion per year are needed in the region for TB-related activities for a meaningful bending of the incidence curve towards ending TB.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2020.

"Secular Seasonality and Trend Forecasting of Tuberculosis Incidence Rate in China Using the Advanced Error-Trend-Seasonal Framework.","10.2147/IDR.S238225","2020","32184635","Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem in China, and contriving a long-term forecast is a useful aid for better launching prevention initiatives. Regrettably, such a forecasting method with robust and accurate performance is still lacking. Here, we aim to investigate its potential of the error-trend-seasonal (ETS) framework through a series of comparative experiments to analyze and forecast its secular epidemic seasonality and trends of TB incidence in China.We collected the TB incidence data from January 1997 to August 2019, and then partitioning the data into eight different training and testing subsamples. Thereafter, we constructed the ETS and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models based on the training subsamples, and multiple performance indices including the mean absolute deviation, mean absolute percentage error, root-mean-squared error, and mean error rate were adopted to assess their simulation and projection effects.In the light of the above performance measures, the ETS models provided a pronounced improvement for the long-term seasonality and trend forecasting in TB incidence rate over the SARIMA models, be it in various training or testing subsets apart from the 48-step ahead forecasting. The descriptive results to the data revealed that TB incidence showed notable seasonal characteristics with predominant peaks of spring and early summer and began to be plunging at on average 3.722% per year since 2008. However, this rate reduced to 2.613% per year since 2015 and furthermore such a trend would be predicted to continue in years ahead.The ETS framework has the ability to conduct long-term forecasting for TB incidence, which may be beneficial for the long-term planning of the TB prevention and control. Additionally, considering the predicted dropping rate of TB morbidity, more particular strategies should be formulated to dramatically accelerate progress towards the goals of the End TB Strategy.© 2020 Wang et al."

The TB Alliance therefore launched the Speeding Treatments to End Pediatric-Tuberculosis (STEP-TB) project to incentivize the introduction of pediatric Fixed-Dose Combinations (FDCs) of TB drugs. This case study describes the elements of this project, evaluates its impact, and highlights future challenges for pediatric TB treatment. The impact assessment incorporates both market impact as well as projected public health impact, evaluating the availability, affordability, and quality of the FDCs, and lastly providing a projection of lives saved as a result of scale-up of the FDCs to near-universal availability and utilization, based on a publicly available pediatric TB-specific model. STEP-TB resulted in the development of two child-friendly FDCs that were successfully brought to market and made available in 20 of the project's 22 high-burden countries. On the basis of a country-specific projection of pediatric TB mortality in Kenya, scale-up to near-universal availability and utilization of the new FDCs could reduce pediatric TB-associated mortality by 2660 cases over the next 5 years. Future challenges include maintaining affordable prices for the FDCs and considering mechanisms to incentivize their introduction among high-risk groups in low-burden countries.© 2019 Atlantis Press International B.V."

Targets were suggested with and without considering minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) information. Individual optimal doses were predicted for patients treated with rifampicin (10 mg/kg) using the targets with Bayesian forecasting together with sparse measurements of rifampicin plasma concentrations and baseline rifampicin MIC.The suggested exposure target for Bayesian dose optimisation was a steady state AUC0-24h of 181-214 h × mg/L. The observed MICs ranged from 0.016-0.125 mg/L (mode: 0.064 mg/L). The predicted optimal dose in patients using the suggested target ranged from 1200-3000 mg (20-50 mg/kg) with a mode of 1800 mg (30 mg/kg, n = 24). The predicted optimal doses when taking MIC into account were highly dependent on the known technical variability of measured individual MIC and the dose was substantially lower compared to when using the AUC0-24h -only target.A new up-to-date exposure target for Bayesian dose optimisation suited for high-dose rifampicin was derived. Using measured plasma concentrations coupled with Bayesian forecasting allowed prediction of the future dose whilst accounting for the auto-induction, saturable pharmacokinetics and high between-occasion variability of rifampicin.© 2019 The British Pharmacological Society."
"Seasonality and Trend Forecasting of Tuberculosis Incidence in Chongqing, China.","10.1007/s12539-019-00318-x","2019 Mar","30734907","Tuberculosis (TB) is a global infectious disease and one of the ten leading causes of death worldwide. As TB incidence is seasonal, a reliable forecasting model that incorporates both seasonal and trend effects would be useful to improve the prevention and control of TB. In this study, the X12 autoregressive integrated moving average (X12-ARIMA) model was constructed by dividing the sequence into season term and trend term to forecast the two terms, respectively. Data regarding the TB report rate from January 2004 to December 2015 were included in the model, and the TB report data from January 2016 to December 2016 were used to validate the results. The X12-ARIMA model was compared with the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. A total of 383,797 cases were reported from January 2004 to December 2016 in Chongqing, China. The report rate of TB was highest in 2005 (151.06 per 100,000 population) and lowest in 2016 (72.58 per 100,000 population). The final X12-ARIMA model included the ARIMA (3,1,3) model for the trend term and the ARIMA (2,1,3) model for the season term. The SARIMA (1,0,2) * (1,1,1)12 model was selected for the SARIMA model. The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of fitting and predicting performance based on the X12-ARIMA model were less than the SARIMA model. In conclusion, the occurrence of TB in Chongqing is controlled, which may be attributed to socioeconomic developments and improved TB prevention and control services. Applying the X12-ARIMA model is an effective method to forecast and analyze the trend and seasonality of TB."

Methods: The monthly incidence data of tuberculosis in China were collected from January 2005 to December 2017. R 3.4.4 software was used to establish the ARIMA model, based on the monthly incidence data of tuberculosis from January 2005 to June 2017. Both predicted and actual data from July to December 2017 were compared to verify the effectiveness of this model, and the number of tuberculosis cases in 2018-2019 also predicted. Results: From 2005 to 2017, a total of 13 022 675 cases of tuberculosis were reported, the number of pulmonary tuberculosis patients in 2017 was 33.68% lower than that in 2005, and the seasonal character was obvious, with the incidence in winter and spring was higher than that in other seasons. According to the incidence data from 2005 to 2017, we established the model of ARIMA (0,1,2)(0,1,0)(12). The relative error between the predicted and actual values of July to December 2017 fitted by the model ranged from 1.67% to 6.80%, and the predicted number of patients in 2018 and 2019 were 789 509 and 760 165 respectively. Conclusion: The ARIMA (0, 1, 2)(0, 1, 0)(12) model well predicted the incidence of tuberculosis, thus can be used for short-term prediction and dynamic analysis of tuberculosis in China, with good application value."

Early warning and advanced response systems play a central role in addressing such a wide-ranging threat. The purpose of this study is to establish a new hybrid model combining a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and a non-linear autoregressive neural network with exogenous input (NARNNX) model to understand the future epidemiological patterns of TB morbidity.We develop a SARIMA-NARNNX hybrid model for forecasting future levels of TB incidence based on data containing 255 observations from January 1997 to March 2018 in mainland China, and the ultimate simulating and forecasting performances were compared with the basic SARIMA, non-linear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) and error-trend-seasonal (ETS) approaches, as well as the SARIMA-generalised regression neural network (GRNN) and SARIMA-NARNN hybrid techniques.In terms of the root mean square error, mean absolute error, mean error rate and mean absolute percentage error, the identified best-fitting SARIMA-NARNNX combined model with 17 hidden neurons and 4 feedback delays had smaller values in both in-sample simulating scheme and the out-of-sample forecasting scheme than the preferred single SARIMA(2,1,3)(0,1,1)12 model, a NARNN with 19 hidden neurons and 6 feedback delays and ETS(M,A,A), and the best-performing SARIMA-GRNN and SARIMA-NARNN models with 32 hidden neurons and 6 feedback delays. Every year, there was an obvious high-risk season for the notified TB cases in March and April. Importantly, the epidemic levels of TB from 2006 to 2017 trended slightly downward. According to the projection results from 2018 to 2025, TB incidence will continue to drop by 3.002% annually but will remain high.The new SARIMA-NARNNX combined model visibly outperforms the other methods. This hybrid model should be used for forecasting the long-term epidemic patterns of TB, and it may serve as a beneficial and effective tool for controlling this disease.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

This study compared the clinical course of LC-IP patients to that of patients without IP (LC without IP) and determined the key factors of survival.We retrieved the records of 52 consecutive LC patients treated at our institution between January 2011 and September 2016. The characteristics and outcomes of LC patients with and without IP were compared. Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate and multivariate analyses of two-year survival were also conducted.Forty-two men and 10 women were evaluated. Eleven patients (21%) had IP as their underlying disease. Except for age, the backgrounds of LC patients with and without IP were almost identical. Among LC-IP patients, the median predicted forced vital capacity was 86% and the Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP) index was 3. None of the LC-IP patients received CRT but 32 (78%) of the LC without IP patients underwent CRT. Chemotherapy alone was the main treatment for LC-IP. The median survival times were 485 and 1271 days in LC patients with and without IP, respectively (p=0.419). Multivariate analysis of survival longer than two years revealed CRT as the only predictive factor.CRT was the only predictive factor for longer survival in LC patients; however, no LC-IP patients received CRT, possibly because of the underlying IP.Copyright © 2019 The Japanese Respiratory Society.

Because protection standards for astronauts are based on individual lifetime risk projections, this sex-specific difference limits the time women can spend in space. Populations exposed to chronic or fractionated radiation were evaluated to learn whether similar differences exist when exposures occur gradually over years.Five occupational cohorts within the Million Person Study of Low-Dose Health Effects (MPS) and a Canadian Fluoroscopy Cohort Study (CFCS) of tuberculosis patients who underwent frequent chest fluoroscopic examinations are evaluated. Included are male and female workers at the Mound nuclear facility, nuclear power plants (NPP), and industrial radiographers (IR). Workers at the Mallinckrodt Chemical Works and military participants at aboveground nuclear weapons tests provide information on the risk among males. Cox proportional hazards and Poisson regression models were used to estimate sex-specific radiation risks for lung cancer and to compare any differences.Overall, 15,065 lung cancers occurred among the 443,684 subjects studied: 50,111 women and 395,573 men. The mean cumulative dose to the lung was 166.3 mGy (range 6 to 1,055 mGy) with the highest among the TB-fluoroscopy patients (mean 1,055 mGy). Mean lung dose for women in the worker cohorts was generally 4 times lower than for men. Of the 12 estimates of radiation-related risk, only one, for male IRs, showed a significant elevation (ERR 0.09; 95% CI 0.02-0.16, at 100 mGy). In contrast, the dose response for male NPP workers was negative (ERR -0.05; 95% CI -0.10, 0.01, at 100 mGy). Combined, these two cohorts provided little evidence for a radiation effect among males (ERR 0.01; 95% CI -0.04, 0.06, at 100 mGy). There was no significant dose-response among females within any cohort. There was no difference in the sex-specific estimates of lung cancer risk.There was little evidence that chronic or fractionated exposures increased the risk of lung cancer. There were no differences in the risks of lung cancer between men and women. However, the sex-specific analyses are limited because of small numbers of women and relatively low doses. A more definitive study is ongoing of medical radiation workers which include 85,000 women and 85,000 men (overall mean dose 82 mGy, max 1,140 mGy). Additional understanding will come from the ongoing follow-up of the CFCS."

Linear regression was applied to analyse the trend of the epidemic, together with the statistical indicator of annual percent change (APC).The overall age-standardised rate decreased from 34.8/100 000 in 1992 to 21.2/100 000 in 2016, or by 2.15% (t = -13.258, P < 0.05) annually. After rapidly declining between 1999 and 2003 (-5.4% p.a.), the epidemic remained at a stable level with a lower annual declining rate (-1.1% p.a). In 2035, the estimated incidence will be 17.2/100 000 based on the APC in 2004-2016. There were two peaks in average incidence of the total population, 30.9/100 000 in the 20-24 age group and 66.4/100 000 in the 70-74 age group. Overall, the ratio of new to retreated cases continually rose and eventually reached 8.36:1 in 2016. The constituent ratio of smear-positive cases ranged from 35.9% to 47.8% without rising or decreasing trend (P = 0.065).The epidemic of TB in Shanghai has steadily declined during last two decades.

"Forecasting the impact of diabetes mellitus on tuberculosis disease incidence and mortality in India.","10.7189/jogh.09.020415","2019 Dec","31673336","In context of the rapidly expanding diabetes mellitus (DM) epidemic in India and slowly declining tuberculosis (TB) incidence, we aimed to estimate the past, current, and future impact of DM on TB epidemiology.An age-structured TB-DM dynamical mathematical model was developed and analyzed to assess the DM-on-TB impact. The model was calibrated using a literature review and meta-analyses. The DM-on-TB impact was analyzed using population attributable fraction metrics. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by accommodating less conservative effect sizes for the TB-DM interactions, by factoring the age-dependence of the TB-DM association, and by assuming different TB disease incidence rate trajectories.In 1990, 11.4% (95% uncertainty interval (UI) = 6.3%-14.4%) of new TB disease incident cases were attributed to DM. This proportion increased to 21.9% (95% UI = 12.1%-26.4%) in 2017, and 33.3% (95% UI = 19.0%-44.1%) in 2050. Similarly, in 1990, 14.5% (95% UI = 9.5%-18.2%) of TB-related deaths were attributed to DM. This proportion increased to 28.9% (95% UI = 18.9%-34.1%) in 2017, and 42.8% (95% UI = 28.7%-53.1%) in 2050. The largest impacts originated from the effects of DM on TB disease progression and infectiousness. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the impact could be even greater.The burgeoning DM epidemic is predicted to become a leading driver of TB disease incidence and mortality over the coming decades. By 2050, at least one-third of TB incidence and almost half of TB mortality in India will be attributed to DM. This is likely generalizable to other Asian Pacific countries with similar TB-DM burdens. Targeting the impact of the increasing DM burden on TB control is critical to achieving the goal of TB elimination by 2050.Copyright © 2019 by the Journal of Global Health. All rights reserved."

However, these methods are either slow or limited in the number of resistant genotypes they can detect. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) we can sidestep all those problems, as we can sequence whole tuberculosis genomes at increasingly smaller costs and requiring less and less DNA. In this review, we explain how accumulated knowledge in the field has allowed us to go from phenotypic testing to molecular methods to Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) for resistance diagnostics. We compare current diagnostic methods with WGS as to their efficacy in detecting resistant cases, and show how forthcoming advances in NGS technologies will be crucial in widespread implementation of WGS as a diagnostic tool.Copyright © 2019 SEPAR.

"Strategies for ending tuberculosis in the South-East Asian Region: A modelling approach.","10.4103/ijmr.IJMR_1901_18","2019 Apr","31411176","To support recent political commitments to end tuberculosis (TB) in the World Health Organization South-East Asian Region (SEAR), there is a need to understand by what measures, and with what investment, these goals could be reached. These questions were addressed by using mathematical models of TB transmission by doing the analysis on a country-by-country basis in SEAR.A dynamical model of TB transmission was developed, in consultation with each of the 11 countries in the SEAR. Three intervention scenarios were examined: (i) strengthening basic TB services (including private sector engagement), (ii) accelerating TB case-finding and notification, and (iii) deployment of a prognostic biomarker test by 2025, to guide mass preventive therapy of latent TB infection. Each scenario was built on the preceding ones, in successive combination.Comprehensive improvements in basic TB services by 2020, in combination with accelerated case-finding to increase TB detection by at least two-fold by 2020, could lead to a reduction in TB incidence rates in SEAR by 67.3 per cent [95% credible intervals (CrI) 65.3-69.8] and TB deaths by 80.9 per cent (95% CrI 77.9-84.7) in 2035, relative to 2015. These interventions alone would require an additional investment of at least US$ 25 billion. However, their combined effect is insufficient to reach the end TB targets of 80 per cent by 2030 and 90 per cent by 2035. Model projections show how additionally, deployment of a biomarker test by 2025 could end TB in the region by 2035. Targeting specific risk groups, such as slum dwellers, could mitigate the coverage needed in the general population, to end TB in the Region.While the scale-up of currently available strategies may play an important role in averting TB cases and deaths in the Region, there will ultimately be a need for novel, mass preventive measures, to meet the end TB goals. Achieving these impacts will require a substantial escalation in funding for TB control in the Region."

Progression risks increase with age. Across the World Health Organisation Western Pacific region, many populations are ageing and have the highest per capita TB incidence rates in older age groups. However, methods for analysing age-specific TB incidence and forecasting epidemic trends while accounting for demographic change remain limited.We applied the Lee-Carter models, which were originally developed for mortality modelling, to model the temporal trends in age-specific TB incidence data from 2005 to 2018 in Taiwan. Females and males were modelled separately. We combined our demographic forecasts, and age-specific TB incidence forecasts to project TB incidence until 2035. We compared TB incidence projections with demography fixed in 2018 to projections accounting for demographic change.Our models quantified increasing incidence rates with age and declining temporal trends. By 2035, the forecast suggests that the TB incidence rate in Taiwan will decrease by 54% (95% Prediction Interval (PI): 45%-59%) compared to 2015, while most age-specific incidence rates will reduce by more than 60%. In 2035, adults aged 65 and above will make up 78% of incident TB cases. Forecast TB incidence in 2035 accounting for demographic change will be 39% (95% PI: 36%-42%) higher than without population ageing.Age-specific incidence forecasts coupled with demographic forecasts can inform the impact of population ageing on TB epidemics. The TB control programme in Taiwan should develop plans specific to older age groups and their care needs."
"Distraction of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit may induce anxiety-like behavior in allergic rhinitis.","10.1371/journal.pone.0221978","2019","31509547","Allergic rhinitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the upper respiratory tract, which is associated with high incidence of anxiety symptom. There is evidence that medial prefrontal cortex modulates anxiety-related behaviors and receives projections from olfactory bulb. Since olfactory dysfunction has been reported in allergic rhinitis, we aimed to evaluate anxiety-like behavior and oscillations of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit in an animal model of allergic rhinitis. The number of open arm entries in elevated zero maze was significantly reduced in sensitized rats exposed to intranasal ovalbumin compared to the control group, which was indicating the enhancement of anxiety-like behavior in allergic rhinitis animals. Analysis of local field potentials in olfactory bulb and medial prefrontal cortex during immobility and exploration state showed that anxiety-like behavior induced by allergic rhinitis was in association with increased activity of medial prefrontal cortex and enhancement of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex coupling in delta and theta bands. Moreover, in allergic rhinitis animals, theta strongly coordinates local gamma activity in olfactory bulb and medial prefrontal cortex, which means to have a strong local theta/gamma coupling. We suggested that disruption of olfactory bulb-medial prefrontal cortex circuit due to allergic reactions might have a governing role for inducing anxiety-like behavior in the allergic rhinitis experimental model."

In this study, we performed validation research by comparing the accuracy of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) model in a southeastern province of China.We applied the data from 462,214 notified pulmonary tuberculosis cases registered from January 2005 to December 2015 in Jiangsu Province to modulate and construct the ARIMA and BPNN models. Cases registered in 2016 were used to assess the prediction accuracy of the models. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error rate (MER) were used to evaluate the model fitting and forecasting effect.During 2005-2015, the annual pulmonary tuberculosis notification rate in Jiangsu Province was 56.35/100,000, ranging from 40.85/100,000 to 79.36/100,000. Through screening and comparison, the ARIMA (0, 1, 2) (0, 1, 1)12 and BPNN (3-9-1) were defined as the optimal fitting models. In the fitting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.3901, 6.0498, 0.2740 and 0.0608, respectively, for the ARIMA (0, 1, 2) (0, 1, 1)12 model, 0.3236, 6.0113, 0.2508 and 0.0587, respectively, for the BPNN model.

We aimed to give an update on the current chronological trends of TB in Southern Tunisia from 1995 to 2016 and to estimate future trajectories of TB epidemic by 2030.We retrospectively collected data of all notified TB new cases by the Center of Tuberculosis Control between 1995 and 2016 in South of Tunisia. Joinpoint Regression Analysis was performed to analyze chronological trends and annual percentage changes (APC) were estimated.In the past 22 years, a total of 2771 cases of TB were notified in Southern Tunisia. The annual incidence rate of TB was 13.91/100,000 population/year. There was a rise in all forms of TB incidence (APC = 1.63) and in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) (APC = 2.04). The incidence of TB increased in children and adult females between 1995 and 2016 (APC = 4.48 and 2.37, respectively). The annual number of TB declined in urban districts between 2004 and 2016 (APC = -2.85). Lymph node TB cases increased (APC = 4.58), while annual number of urogenital TB decreased between 1995 and 2016 (APC = -3.38). Projected incidence rates would increase to 18.13 and 11.8/100,000 population in 2030 for global TB and EPTB, respectively.Our study highlighted a rise in all forms of TB and among high-risk groups, notably children, females and lymph node TB patients in the last two decades and up to the next one."
"Application of a hybrid model in predicting the incidence of tuberculosis in a Chinese population.","10.2147/IDR.S190418","2019","31118707","Objective: To investigate suitable forecasting models for tuberculosis (TB) in a Chinese population by comparing the predictive value of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) hybrid model. Methods: We used the monthly incidence rate of TB in Lianyungang city from January 2007 through June 2016 to construct a fitting model, and we used the incidence rate from July 2016 to December 2016 to evaluate the forecasting accuracy. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean error rate (MER) were used to assess the performance of these models in fitting and forecasting the incidence of TB. Results: The ARIMA (10, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1)12 model was selected from plausible ARIMA models, and the optimal spread value of the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model was 0.23. For the fitting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.5594, 11.5000, 0.4202 and 0.1132, respectively, for the ARIMA (10, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1)12 model, and 0.5259, 11.2181, 0.3992 and 0.1075, respectively, for the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model. For the forecasting dataset, the RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MER were 0.2805, 8.8797, 0.2261 and 0.0851, respectively, for the ARIMA (10, 1, 0) (0, 1, 1)12 model, and 0.2553, 5.7222, 0.1519 and 0.0571, respectively, for the ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model. Conclusions: The ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model was shown to be superior to the single ARIMA model in predicting the short-term TB incidence in the Chinese population, especially in fitting and forecasting the peak and trough incidence."
"Spatial and temporal projections of the prevalence of active tuberculosis in Cambodia.","10.1136/bmjgh-2018-001083","2019","30740249","Cambodia is among the 30 highest burden of tuberculosis (TB) countries. Active TB prevalence has been estimated using nationally representative multistage sampling that represents urban, rural and remote parts of the country, but the prevalence in non-sampled communes remains unknown. This study uses geospatial Bayesian statistics to estimate point prevalence across Cambodia, and demographic modelling that accounts for secular trends in fertility, mortality, urbanisation and prevalence rates to project the future burden of active TB.A Bayesian hierarchical model was developed for the 2011 National Tuberculosis Prevalence survey to estimate the differential effect of age, sex and geographic stratum on active TB prevalence; these estimates were then married with high-resolution geographic information system layers to project prevalence across Cambodia. Future TB projections under alternative scenarios were then derived by interfacing these estimates with an individual-based demographic model.Strong differences in risk by age and sex, together with geographically varying population structures, yielded the first estimated prevalence map at a 1 km scale. The projected number of active TB cases within the catchment area of each existing government healthcare facility was derived, together with projections to the year 2030 under three scenarios: no future improvement, continualreduction and GDPprojection.Synthesis of health and geographic data allows likely disease rates to be mapped at a high resolution to facilitate resource planning, while demographic modelling allows scenarios to be projected, demonstrating the need for the acceleration of control efforts to achieve a substantive impact on the future burden of TB in Cambodia."
"Application of provincial data in mathematical modelling to inform sub-national tuberculosis program decision-making in South Africa.","10.1371/journal.pone.0209320","2019","30682028","South Africa has the highest tuberculosis (TB) disease incidence rate in the world, and TB is the leading infectious cause of death. Decisions on, and funding for, TB prevention and care policies are decentralised to the provincial governments and therefore, tools to inform policy need to operate at this level. We describe the use of a mathematical model planning tool at provincial level in a high HIV and TB burden country, to estimate the impact on TB burden of achieving the 90-(90)-90 targets of the Stop TB Partnership Global Plan to End TB. ""TIME Impact"" is a freely available, user-friendly TB modelling tool. In collaboration with provincial TB programme staff, and the South African National TB Programme, models for three (of nine) provinces were calibrated to TB notifications, incidence, and screening data. Reported levels of TB programme activities were used as baseline inputs into the models, which were used to estimate the impact of scale-up of interventions focusing on screening, linkage to care and treatment success. All baseline models predicted a trend of decreasing TB incidence and mortality, consistent with recent data from South Africa. The projected impacts of the interventions differed by province and were greatly influenced by assumed current coverage levels. The absence of provincial TB burden estimates and uncertainty in current activity coverage levels were key data gaps. A user-friendly modelling tool allows TB burden and intervention impact projection at the sub-national level. Key sub-national data gaps should be addressed to improve the quality of sub-national model predictions."

Fifty-four patients had infectious and 254 had non-infectious uveitis. In infectious panuveitis, vision remained unchanged at last visit. The most frequent diagnosis was presumed intraocular tuberculosis (PIOTB) uveitis (48.1%). In the non-infectious subgroup vision increased significantly by 2 lines at last visit (p = 0.020). The most common diagnose was Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease (38.6%). Initial therapy was oral prednisone in 86.6% with non-infectious etiology followed by immunosuppressive agents. Surgery secondary to complications (mainly cataracts) was performed in 46.7% patients.Conclusion: In Saudi Arabia, panuveitis was mainly due to VHK. PIOTB was the most common etiology for infectious panuveitis. Immunosuppressive therapy and surgery maintained BCVA in non-infectious panuveitis."
"A new bovine tuberculosis model for England and Wales (BoTMEW) to simulate epidemiology, surveillance and control.","10.1186/s12917-018-1595-9","2018 Sep 4","30176863","Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a zoonotic disease of cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, widespread in England and Wales. It has high incidence towards the South West of England and Wales, with much lower incidence to the East and North. A stochastic simulation model was developed to simulate M. bovis transmission among cattle, transfer by cattle movements and transmission from environmental reservoirs (often wildlife and especially badgers). It distinguishes five surveillance streams, including herd tests, pre-movement testing and slaughter surveillance. The model thereby simulates interventions in bTB surveillance and control, and generates outputs directly comparable to detailed disease records. An anonymized version of the executable model with its input data has been released. The model was fitted to cattle bTB records for 2008-2010 in a cross-sectional comparison, and its projection was compared with records from 2010 to 2016 for validation.The fitted model explained over 99% of the variation among numbers of breakdowns in four defined regions and surveillance streams in 2010. It classified 7800 (95% confidence interval c. 5500 - 14,000) holdings within high incidence regions as exposed to infectious environmental reservoirs, out of over 31,000 cattle holdings identified as potentially exposed to such sources. The model was consistent with previous estimates of low M. bovis transmission rate among cattle, but cattle to cattle transmission was clearly required to generate the number of cattle cases observed. When projected to 2016, the model as fitted to 2010 continued to match the distribution of bTB among counties, although it was notable that the actual distribution of bTB in 2010 was itself a close match for its distribution in 2016.The close model fit demonstrated that cattle movements could generate breakdowns as observed in low incidence regions, if persistent environmental reservoirs such as wildlife maintained infection levels in the high incidence regions. The model suggests that environmental reservoirs may be a challenge for control, because, although many holdings are exposed to infection from wildlife or the environment, they are a minority of holdings. Large impacts on disease in wildlife will be required to avoid each individual transmission event to cattle."

"Measuring catastrophic costs due to tuberculosis in Viet Nam.","10.5588/ijtld.17.0859","2018 Sep 1","30092862","Progress towards ending tuberculosis (TB) in Viet Nam includes monitoring the costs borne by patients through periodic facility-based surveys.To document the magnitude of costs incurred by TB-affected households and establish a baseline for the top End TB indicator in Viet Nam.A national survey with retrospective data collection and projection among 735 participants in 20 stratified clusters was conducted in 2016. Each patient was interviewed on costs, time loss, coping measures and asset ownership. Total costs were expressed as a proportion of annual household income.In Viet Nam, 63% of households affected by TB or multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) experienced costs that were >20% of their annual household income. The mean patient costs were respectively US$1054 and US$4302 per episode of TB and MDR-TB. The most significant drivers of mean costs were income loss reported and purchase of special foods, nutritional supplements, travel and accommodation.The proportion of households experiencing catastrophic total costs due to TB in Viet Nam is high, which poses a barrier to TB diagnosis and treatment. Based on study results, programme and partners need to identify key areas for policy action and work towards a national policy guide on intervention to reduce TB patient costs."

Cities witnessing religious event throughout of the year like Kerbala/Iraq require great efforts to minimize the incidence of deadly communicable diseases like TB. The aim of this study is to model the monthly incidence rates of PTB cases in Kerbala/Iraq.This is a retrospective study in which records of confirmed PTB patients whom they referred to the chest and respiratory illnesses center of Holy Kerbala governorate were obtained. Monthly registered new smear-positive PTB cases from January 2010 to December 2016 were analyzed. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), SARIMA-exponential smoothing method (ETS), SARIMA-neural network autoregressive, and SARIMA-adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (SARIMA-ANFIS) were used for forecasting monthly incidence rate of TB in Kerbala, Iraq. Mean absolute percentage error, root mean square error, and mean absolute square error were used to compare the models, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) were used to selected best model.The trend of PTB incidence showed a seasonal characteristic, with peaks in spring and winter. Predicted estimates using all models proposed to forecast the number of PTB cases from 2016 to 2018 showed that the PTB cases indicated marginal decrease trends and best forecasted in SARIMA-ANFIS model (the lower AIC and BIC values, 712.69 and 731.05, respectively).Seasonal characteristic of PTB incidence was observed with peaks during spring and winter. Forecasting of PTB incidence between the period 2016 and 2018 showed marginal decrease trends, and the best forecasting model was SARIMA-ANFIS model."

The primary aim of this review is to showcase the current and emerging diagnostic techniques that are used in lung cancer detection. Lung cancer is a leading cause of death among smokers and it has been emerging in non-smokers due to passive smoke inhalation by non-smokers. The mortality rate of patients with lung cancer is very high due to the change in lifestyle and environmental factors. It is often misdiagnosed as tuberculosis in India as tuberculosis is prevalent in India. On the contrary tuberculosis is not prevalent in the western countries Like U.S.A., U.K., Canada, etc. The major setback in lung cancer is that the symptoms of lung cancer occur at very later stages when the tumor has spread profusely. Hence, highly advanced techniques are employed for detection, accurate staging and treatment of lung cancer. The review focuses on the various novel and emerging diagnostic tools like biomarkers and biosensors, radiogenomics and artificial intelligence. This review also gives an insight of the various conventional techniques like CT-imaging, sputum cytology, biopsy and bronchoscopy which have been modified over the years for better sensitivity and accuracy. It also encompasses the regulatory provisions like IDE, CLIA-certification, etc. for manufacturing and sale of diagnostics in India, U.S.A., Japan and Australia.Copyright © 2018.

The standardised data set of an accident insurer was used to analyse the time trends of infection-related claims and confirmed occupational diseases (ODs) in HWs. The numbers of claims and confirmed claims for different infections were analysed for the years 1996 to 2017. The rate of claims and confirmed ODs were calculated per 100,000 full-time workers. The number of claims was relatively stable over time. However, the rate per 100,000 full-time workers decreased from 25.2 to 15.4. The decrease was most pronounced for hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections, which were the most frequent infections for which claims were made at the start of the period. In 2017, tuberculosis (TB)-related claims were more frequent than those related to blood-borne virus infections. However, the growing number of TB claims does not reflect an increased infection risk, but rather improved methods for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI). Measures to prevent blood-borne virus infections in HWs were successful in the last 22 years, but attention should be paid to newly emerging infections."

Trends and seasonal changes in the number of patients presenting with TB have been studied worldwide including sub-Saharan Africa. However, these changes are unknown at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH). The aim of this study was to obtain a time series model to estimate the incidence of TB cases at the chest clinic of the Korle-Bu Teaching hospital.A time series analysis using a Box-Jenkins approach propounded as an autoregressive moving average (ARIMA) was conducted on the monthly TB cases reported at the KBTH from 2008 to 2017. Various models were stated and compared and the best was found to be based on the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion.There was no evidence of obvious increasing or decreasing trend in the TB data. The log-transformed of the data achieved stationarity with fairly stable variations around the mean of the series. ARIMA (1, 0, 1) or ARMA (1,1) was obtained as the best model. The monthly forecasted values of the best model ranged from 53 to 55 for the year 2018; however, the best model does not always produce the best results with respect to the mean absolute and mean square errors.Irregular fluctuations were observed in the 10 -year data studied. The model equation to estimate the expected monthly TB cases at KBTH produced an AR coefficient of 0.971 plus an MA coefficient of - 0.826 with a constant value of 4.127. The result is important for developing a hypothesis to explain the dynamics of TB occurrence so as to outline prevention programmes, optimal use of resources and effective service delivery."

Digital health technologies could help improve treatment outcomes. We considered their potential cost and impact on treatment for active or latent TB in Brazil.Decision analysis models simulated two adult cohorts with 1) drug-susceptible active TB, and 2) multidrug-resistant TB, and two cohorts treated with isoniazid for latent TB infection (LTBI): 1) close contacts of persons with active TB, and 2) others newly diagnosed with LTBI. We evaluated four digital support strategies: two different medication monitors, synchronous video-observed therapy (VOT), and two-way short message service (SMS). Comparators were standard directly observed treatment for active TB and self-administered treatment for LTBI. Projected outcomes included costs (2016 US dollars), plus active TB cases and disability-adjusted life years averted among persons with LTBI.For individuals with active TB, medication monitors and VOT are projected to lead to substantial (up to 58%) cost savings, in addition to alleviating inconvenience and cost to patients of supervised treatment visits. For LTBI treatment, SMS and medication monitors are projected to be the most cost-effective interventions. However, all projections are limited by the scarcity of published estimates of clinical effect for the digital technologies.Copyright ©ERS 2018."

Demographic, clinical and laboratory features are described. Clinical outcomes were defined according to World Health Organization definitions of treatment success (cure and treatment completion), treatment failure, death, loss to follow-up (including transfer out), or not evaluated at treatment completion.A total of 244 cases of MDR-TB were diagnosed in Australia during the study period, representing 1.4% of all TB cases notified. The majority were born outside Australia, including one third in Papua New Guinea. Of those with treatment outcome data available, treatment success was demonstrated in 81%. Treatment success was positively associated with use of a second-line injectable agent. Those born in Papua New Guinea were less likely to achieve treatment success.MDR-TB is uncommon in Australia. The large number of cases born in Papua New Guinea, and the poorer outcomes in this cohort, represent challenges with cross-border management of MDR-TB in the Torres Strait. Australia has an ongoing role in the prevention and management of MDR-TB locally and in the region."

"Dynamic Models of Infectious Disease Transmission in Prisons and the General Population.","10.1093/epirev/mxx014","2018 Jun 1","29566137","Incarcerated populations experience elevated burdens of infectious diseases, which are exacerbated by limited access to prevention measures. Dynamic models are used to assess the spread and control of diseases within correctional facilities and repercussions on the general population. Our systematic review of dynamic models of infectious diseases within correctional settings identified 34 studies published between 1996 and 2017. Of these, 23 focused on disease dynamics and intervention in prison without accounting for subsequent spread to the community. The main diseases modeled in these studies were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; n = 14, 41%), tuberculosis (TB; n = 10, 29%), and hepatitis C virus (HCV; n = 7, 21%). Models were fitted to epidemiologic data in 14 studies; uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted in 8, and validation of model projection against empirical data was done in 1 study. According to the models, prison-based screening and treatment may be highly effective strategies for reducing the burden of HIV, TB, HCV, and other sexually transmissible infections among prisoners and the general community. Decreasing incarceration rates were projected to reduce HIV and HCV infections among people who inject drugs and TB infections among all prisoners. Limitations of the modeling studies and opportunities for using dynamic models to develop quantitative evidence for informing prison infection control measures are discussed."

Event rates were compared across biologic classes using Cox proportional hazards with adjustment for potential confounders identified a priori. Analysis of the incidence of TB was performed separately.In total, 19 282 patients with 106 347 years of follow-up were studied; 142 non-TB OI were identified at a rate of 134 cases/100 000 patient years (pyrs). The overall incidence of OI was not significantly different between the different drug classes; however, the rate of Pneumocystis infection was significantly higher with rituximab than with anti-TNF therapy (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.4, 7.5). The rate of TB fell dramatically over the study period (783 cases/100 000 pyrs in 2002 to 38 cases/100 000 pyrs in 2015). The incidence of TB was significantly lower among rituximab users than anti-TNF users, with 12 cases/100 000 pyrs compared with 65 cases/100 000 pyrs.The overall rate of OI was not significantly different between drug classes; however, a subtle difference in the pattern of OI was seen between the cohorts.

While the frequency of stock-outs has remained rather stable, duration increased in 2014-2015 due to manufacturing issues and attracted the attention of national, regional and global immunization stakeholders. This prompted an in-depth analysis of supply and demand dynamics aiming to characterize supply risks. This analysis is unique as it provides a global picture, where previous analyses have focused on a portion of the market procuring through UN entities. Through literature review, supplier interviews, appraisal of shortages, stock-outs and historical procurement data, and through demand forecasting, this analysis shows an important increase in global capacity in 2017: supply is sufficient to meet forecasted BCG vaccine demand and possibly buffer market shocks. Nevertheless, risks remain mainly due to supply concentration and limited investment in production process improvements, as well as inflexibility in demand. Identification of these market risks will allow implementation of risk-mitigating interventions in three areas: (1) enhancing information sharing between major global health actors, countries and suppliers, (2) identifying interests and incentives to expand product registration and investment in the BCG manufacturing process, and (3) working with countries for tighter vaccine management.Copyright © 2017.

"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease guidelines in Europe: a look into the future.","10.1186/s12931-018-0715-1","2018 Jan 18","29347928","Clinical practice guidelines are ubiquitous and are developed to provide recommendations for the management of many diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The development of these guidelines is burdensome, demanding a significant investment of time and money. In Europe, the majority of countries develop their own national guidelines, despite the potential for overlap or duplication of effort. A concerted effort and consolidation of resources between countries may alleviate the resource-intensity of maintaining individual national guidelines. Despite significant resource investment into the development and maintenance of clinical practice guidelines, their implementation is suboptimal. Effective strategies of guideline dissemination must be given more consideration, to ensure adequate implementation and improved patient care management in the future."
"Estimating the HIV undiagnosed population in Catalonia, Spain: descriptive and comparative data analysis to identify differences in MSM stratified by migrant and Spanish-born population.","10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018533","2018 Feb 28","29490955","Undiagnosed HIV continues to be a hindrance to efforts aimed at reducing incidence of HIV. The objective of this study was to provide an estimate of the HIV undiagnosed population in Catalonia and compare the HIV care cascade with this step included between high-risk populations.To estimate HIV incidence, time between infection and diagnosis and the undiagnosed population stratified by CD4 count, we used the ECDC HIV Modelling Tool V.1.2.2. This model uses data on new HIV and AIDS diagnoses from the Catalan HIV/AIDS surveillance system from 2001 to 2013. Data used to estimate the proportion of people enrolled, on ART and virally suppressed in the HIV care cascade were derived from the PISCIS cohort.The total number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Catalonia in 2013 was 34 729 (32 740 to 36 827), with 12.3% (11.8 to 18.1) of whom were undiagnosed. By 2013, there were 8458 (8101 to 9079) Spanish-born men who have sex with men (MSM) and 2538 (2334 to 2918) migrant MSM living with HIV in Catalonia. A greater proportion of migrant MSM than local MSM was undiagnosed (32% vs 22%). In the subsequent steps of the HIV care cascade, migrants MSM experience greater losses than the Spanish-born MSM: in retention in care (74% vs 55%), in the proportion on combination antiretroviral treatment (70% vs 50%) and virally suppressed (65% vs 46%).By the end of 2013, there were an estimated 34 729 PLHIV in Catalonia, of whom 4271 were still undiagnosed. This study shows that the Catalan epidemic of HIV has continued to expand with the key group sustaining HIV transmission being MSM living with undiagnosed HIV.© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

"Diagnoses and ordering practices driving blood demand for treatment of anemia in Tanzania.","10.1111/trf.14461","2018 Feb","29350415","Resource-limited countries in Africa experience blood shortages. Understanding clinical drivers of blood demand can inform strategies to increase blood availability.From a national representative sample of 42 hospitals in Tanzania, patient records and requests for whole blood (WB) and red blood cells (RBCs) to treat anemia were analyzed using data collected prospectively from June through September 2013. Abstracted data included cause of anemia, number of requested units, clinical signs, and pretransfusion hemoglobin (Hb) levels. Weighted projections of nationwide drivers of blood demand for the year, 2013, were calculated. Mean posttransfusion Hb levels were estimated, and blood requests were assessed for clinical appropriateness.Malaria was the leading driver of blood demand for anemia among children, accounting for 67% (55,949 units; standard deviation [SD], 1911 units) of projected units requested for children in 2013. Maternal hemorrhage was the leading driver of blood demand for anemia among adults, accounting for 21% (31,321 units; SD, 963 units) of projected units requested. Seventeen percent (26,133 units; SD, 1013 units) of projected requested units were deemed inappropriate. Adults with severe anemia had a mean Hb level of 3.7 g/dL and a mean of 1.6 WB or RBC units per request, resulting in an estimated mean posttransfusion Hb level of 5.3 g/dL.Strategies to prevent and treat underlying causes of anemia and decrease inappropriate blood requests will likely increase blood availability. Restrictive blood ordering practices seen in adults with severe anemia suggests undertreatment of anemia and may result in an underestimation of the national blood demand.© 2018 AABB."
"Future directions for notifiable diseases: tuberculosis-related laws in the Philippines.","10.1186/s12992-018-0405-2","2018 Aug 22","30134993","With the increasing burden of tuberculosis (TB) in the Philippines, and the risk of multidrug resistance to TB, there is a need to strengthen the surveillance system. In many countries, cases of TB are reported to health authorities, and reporting is an effective way to manage TB. Although TB is a universal and representative reportable disease, the Philippines does not designate it as a notifiable disease.This study aimed to review and compare current communicable disease-related laws and regulations in the Philippines with relevant international laws and regulations in other countries, to highlight where current TB notification regulations require change, or to determine whether they reflect global trends. Furthermore, we aimed to have TB included along with other communicable diseases on the list of legally required notifiable diseases in the Philippines. We reviewed current TB-related laws, acts of parliament, executive orders, presidential decrees, administrative orders, and memorandums. We undertook a literature review of relevant World Health Organization documentation, with 17 countries selected for comparison. Data on reported TB cases in the Philippines were obtained from health authorities, and health legislation data from foreign countries was collected from a public law database or from the government websites of each country. Most of the selected countries have a legislative basis for regulating notifiable diseases. In many countries, including Australia, Canada, China, Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and Vanuatu, laws on communicable disease notification include TB notification. Our results suggest that notification of communicable diseases should be enforced through domestic health legislation.To align the Philippines with standard practice in the selected countries, TB could be included on the list of notifiable diseases in one of two ways. First, the current regulation ""Revised List of Notifiable Diseases, Syndromes, Health-related Events and Conditions of 2008"" could be revised to include TB. Second, new TB regulations could be introduced and implemented. Any revisions or new regulations should specify methods to identify and manage TB, and safeguard individual rights."
"Seasonal patterns of tuberculosis case notification in the tropics of Africa: A six-year trend analysis in Ethiopia.","10.1371/journal.pone.0207552","2018","30475836","Seasonal variations affect the health system's functioning, including tuberculosis (TB) services, but there is little evidence about seasonal variations in TB case notification in tropical countries, including Ethiopia. This study sought to fill this gap in knowledge using TB data reported from 10 zones, 5 each from Amhara and Oromia regions.Notified TB cases for 2010-2016 were analyzed using SPSS version 20. We calculated the quarterly and annual average TB case notification rates and the proportion of seasonal amplitudes. We applied Winters' multiplicative method of exponential smoothing to break down the original time series into seasonal, trend, and irregular components and to build a suitable model for forecasting.A total of 205,575 TB cases were identified (47.8% from Amhara, 52.2% from Oromia), with a male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1. The means of 8,200 (24%), 7,992 (23%), 8,849 (26%), and 9,222 (27%) TB cases were reported during July-September, October-December, January-March, and April-June, respectively. The seasonal component of our model indicated a peak in April-June and a trough in October-December. The seasonal amplitude in Amhara region is 10% greater than that of Oromia (p < 0.05).TB is shown to be a seasonal disease in Ethiopia, with a peak in quarter four and a low in quarter two of the fiscal year. The peak TB case notification rate corresponds with the end of the dry season in the two agrarian regions of Ethiopia. TB prevention and control interventions, such as efforts to increase community TB awareness about TB transmission and contact tracing, should consider seasonal variation. Regional variations in TB seasonality may require consideration of geographic-specific TB case-finding strategies. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal variation of TB are complex, and further study is needed."
"Feature selection and prediction of treatment failure in tuberculosis.","10.1371/journal.pone.0207491","2018","30458029","Tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. Drug resistance, which is predicted to rise in many countries worldwide, threatens tuberculosis treatment and control.To identify features associated with treatment failure and to predict which patients are at highest risk of treatment failure.On a multi-country dataset managed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases we applied various machine learning techniques to identify factors statistically associated with treatment failure and to predict treatment failure based on baseline demographic and clinical characteristics alone.The complete-case analysis database consisted of 587 patients (68% males) with a median (p25-p75) age of 40 (30-51) years. Treatment failure occurred in approximately one fourth of the patients. The features most associated with treatment failure were patterns of drug sensitivity, imaging findings, findings in the microscopy Ziehl-Nielsen stain, education status, and employment status. The most predictive model was forward stepwise selection (AUC: 0.74), although most models performed at or above AUC 0.7. A sensitivity analysis using the 643 original patients filling the missing values with multiple imputation showed similar predictive features and generally increased predictive performance.Machine learning can help to identify patients at higher risk of treatment failure. Closer monitoring of these patients may decrease treatment failure rates and prevent emergence of antibiotic resistance. The use of inexpensive basic demographic and clinical features makes this approach attractive in low and middle-income countries."
"Measuring progress and projecting attainment on the basis of past trends of the health-related Sustainable Development Goals in 188 countries: an analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016.","10.1016/S0140-6736(17)32336-X","2017 Sep 16","28916366","The UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are grounded in the global ambition of ""leaving no one behind"". Understanding today's gains and gaps for the health-related SDGs is essential for decision makers as they aim to improve the health of populations. As part of the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016), we measured 37 of the 50 health-related SDG indicators over the period 1990-2016 for 188 countries, and then on the basis of these past trends, we projected indicators to 2030.We used standardised GBD 2016 methods to measure 37 health-related indicators from 1990 to 2016, an increase of four indicators since GBD 2015. We substantially revised the universal health coverage (UHC) measure, which focuses on coverage of essential health services, to also represent personal health-care access and quality for several non-communicable diseases. We transformed each indicator on a scale of 0-100, with 0 as the 2·5th percentile estimated between 1990 and 2030, and 100 as the 97·5th percentile during that time. An index representing all 37 health-related SDG indicators was constructed by taking the geometric mean of scaled indicators by target. On the basis of past trends, we produced projections of indicator values, using a weighted average of the indicator and country-specific annualised rates of change from 1990 to 2016 with weights for each annual rate of change based on out-of-sample validity. 24 of the currently measured health-related SDG indicators have defined SDG targets, against which we assessed attainment.Globally, the median health-related SDG index was 56·7 (IQR 31·9-66·8) in 2016 and country-level performance markedly varied, with Singapore (86·8, 95% uncertainty interval 84·6-88·9), Iceland (86·0, 84·1-87·6), and Sweden (85·6, 81·8-87·8) having the highest levels in 2016 and Afghanistan (10·9, 9·6-11·9), the Central African Republic (11·0, 8·8-13·8), and Somalia (11·3, 9·5-13·1) recording the lowest. Between 2000 and 2016, notable improvements in the UHC index were achieved by several countries, including Cambodia, Rwanda, Equatorial Guinea, Laos, Turkey, and China; however, a number of countries, such as Lesotho and the Central African Republic, but also high-income countries, such as the USA, showed minimal gains. Based on projections of past trends, the median number of SDG targets attained in 2030 was five (IQR 2-8) of the 24 defined targets currently measured. Globally, projected target attainment considerably varied by SDG indicator, ranging from more than 60% of countries projected to reach targets for under-5 mortality, neonatal mortality, maternal mortality ratio, and malaria, to less than 5% of countries projected to achieve targets linked to 11 indicator targets, including those for childhood overweight, tuberculosis, and road injury mortality. For several of the health-related SDGs, meeting defined targets hinges upon substantially faster progress than what most countries have achieved in the past.GBD 2016 provides an updated and expanded evidence base on where the world currently stands in terms of the health-related SDGs. Our improved measure of UHC offers a basis to monitor the expansion of health services necessary to meet the SDGs. Based on past rates of progress, many places are facing challenges in meeting defined health-related SDG targets, particularly among countries that are the worst off. In view of the early stages of SDG implementation, however, opportunity remains to take actions to accelerate progress, as shown by the catalytic effects of adopting the Millennium Development Goals after 2000. With the SDGs' broader, bolder development agenda, multisectoral commitments and investments are vital to make the health-related SDGs within reach of all populations.Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

"A New Hybrid Model Using an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and a Generalized Regression Neural Network for the Incidence of Tuberculosis in Heng County, China.","10.4269/ajtmh.16-0648","2017 Sep","28820678","It is a daunting task to eradicate tuberculosis completely in Heng County due to a large transient population, human immunodeficiency virus/tuberculosis coinfection, and latent infection. Thus, a high-precision forecasting model can be used for the prevention and control of tuberculosis. In this study, four models including a basic autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a traditional ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model, a basic GRNN model, and a new ARIMA-GRNN hybrid model were used to fit and predict the incidence of tuberculosis. Parameters including mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean square error (MSE) were used to evaluate and compare the performance of these models for fitting historical and prospective data. The new ARIMA-GRNN model had superior fit relative to both the traditional ARIMA-GRNN model and basic ARIMA model when applied to historical data and when used as a predictive model for forecasting incidence during the subsequent 6 months. Our results suggest that the new ARIMA-GRNN model may be more suitable for forecasting the tuberculosis incidence in Heng County than traditional models."
"Comparing Drivers and Dynamics of Tuberculosis in California, Florida, New York, and Texas.","10.1164/rccm.201702-0377OC","2017 Oct 15","28475845","There is substantial state-to-state heterogeneity in tuberculosis (TB) in the United States; better understanding this heterogeneity can inform effective response to TB at the state level, the level at which most TB control efforts are coordinated.To characterize drivers of state-level heterogeneity in TB epidemiology in the four U.S. states that bear half the country's TB burden: California, Florida, New York, and Texas.We constructed an individual-based model of TB in the four U.S. states and calibrated the model to state-specific demographic and age- and nativity-stratified TB incidence data. We used the model to infer differences in natural history of TB and in future projections of TB.We found that differences in both demographic makeup (particularly the size and composition of the foreign-born population) and TB transmission dynamics contribute to state-level differences in TB epidemiology. The projected median annual rate of decline in TB incidence in the next decade was substantially higher in Texas (3.3%; 95% range, -5.6 to 10.9) than in California (1.7%; 95% range, -3.8 to 7.1), Florida (1.5%; 95% range, -7.4 to 14), and New York (1.9%; 95% range, -6.4 to 9.8). All scenarios projected a flattening of the decline in TB incidence by 2025 without additional resources or interventions.There is substantial state-level heterogeneity in TB epidemiology in the four states, which reflect both demographic factors and potential differences in the natural history of TB. These differences may inform resource allocation decisions in these states."
"A model of population dynamics of TB in a prison system and application to South Africa.","10.1186/s13104-017-2968-z","2017 Nov 29","29187239","Tuberculosis (TB) continues to spread in South African prisons in particular, as prisons are over-capacitated and have poor ventilation. The awaiting trial detainees are not screened on admission and are at high risk of getting infected with TB.We propose a compartmental model to describe the population dynamics of TB disease in prisons. Our model considers the inflow of susceptible, exposed and TB infectives into the prison population. Removal of individuals out of the prison population can be either by death or by being released from prison, as compared to a general population in which removal is only by death. We describe conditions, including non-inflow of infectives into the prison, which will ensure that TB can be eradicated from the prison population. The model is calibrated for the South African prison system, by using data in existing literature. The model can be used to make quantitative projections of TB prevalence and to measure the effect of interventions. Illustrative simulations in this regard are presented. The model can be used for other prison populations too, if data is available to calculate the model parameters.Various simulations generated with our model serve to illustrate how it can be utilized in making future projections of the levels of prevalence of TB, and to quantify the effect of interventions such as screening, treatment or reduction of transmission parameter values through improved living conditions for inmates. This makes it particularly useful as there are various targets set by the World Health Organization and by governments, for reduction of TB prevalence and ultimately its eradication. Towards eradication of TB from a prison system, the theorem on global stability of the disease-free state is a useful indicator."
"Progress and prospects for the control of HIV and tuberculosis in South Africa: a dynamical modelling study.","10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30066-X","2017 May","29253488","In September, 2016, South Africa adopted a policy of providing antiretroviral treatment to everyone infected with HIV irrespective of their CD4 cell count. Studies of universal treatment and expanded prevention of HIV differ widely in their projections of effects and the associated costs, so we did this analysis to attempt to find a consensus.We used data on HIV from the Joint UN Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) from 1988 to 2013 and from data from WHO on tuberculosis from 1980 to to 2013 to fit a dynamical model to time trends in HIV prevalence, antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage, and tuberculosis notification rates in South Africa. We then used the model to estimate current trends and project future patterns in HIV prevalence and incidence, AIDS-related mortality, and tuberculosis notification rates, and we used data from the South African National AIDS Council to assess current and future costs under different combinations of treatment and prevention approaches. We considered two treatment strategies: the Constant Effort strategy, in which people infected with HIV continue to start treatment at the rate in 2016, and the Expanded Treatment and Prevention (ETP) strategy, in which testing rates are increased, treatment is started immediately after HIV is detected, and prevention programmes are expanded.Our estimates show that HIV incidence among adults aged 15 years or older fell from 2·3% per year in 1996 to 0·65% per year in 2016, AIDS-related mortality decreased from 1·4% per year in 2006 to 0·37% per year in 2016, and both continue to fall at a relative rate of 17% per year. Our model shows that maintenance of Constant Effort will have a substantial effect on HIV but will not end AIDS, whereas ETP could end AIDS by 2030, with incidence of HIV and AIDs-related mortality rates both at less than one event per 1000 adults per year. Under ETP the annual cost of health care and prevention will increase from US$2·3 billion in 2016 to $2·9 billion in 2018, then decrease to $1·7 billion in 2030 and $0·9 billion in 2050. Over the next 35 years, the expansion of treatment will avert an additional 3·8 million new infections, save 1·1 million lives, and save $3·2 billion compared with continuing Constant Effort up to 2050. Expansion of prevention, including provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis, condom distribution, and male circumcision, could avert a further 150 000 new infections, save 5000 lives, and cost an additional $5·7 billion compared with Constant Effort.Our results suggest that South Africa is on track to reduce HIV incidence and AIDS-related mortality substantially by 2030, saving both lives and money. Success will depend on high rates of HIV testing, ART delivery and adherence, good patient monitoring and support, and data to monitor progress.None.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

"The challenge of the new tuberculosis drugs.","10.1016/j.lpm.2017.01.016","2017 Mar","28256383","Tuberculosis (TB) continues to cause more deaths worldwide than any other single infectious disease. Even though tuberculosis appears to be decreasing in incidence globally for some time, the proportion of drug resistance is increasing, contributing to greater complexity, morbidity and mortality as well as cost. Since the advent of rifampicin in the 1960s, and the implementation of standard quadruple anti-tuberculosis regimen in the late 1970s, no new drugs have been changed the first line regimen. This regimen is effective however it is pill burden, and duration has not received investment and innovation. Drug-resistant regimens are long and frequently poorly tolerated due to significant toxicity. This review is an update on what is new in the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis, new TB drugs currently being used and studied in clinical trials are also mentioned. Fortunately, there have been many significant advances in this field in recent years. The horizon is changing with the new WHO shorter multidrug-resistant tuberculosis regimens and with the increasing availability of new or repurposed drugs like bedaquiline, delamanid, clofazimine and linezolid. These drugs pose new challenges relating to their rational use to prevent selection of resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis even before a new regimen has been studied. The availability of these new drugs is offering hope and new possibilities for saving patients who had few or no treatment options. Their use and combination into effective regimens need to be studied; trials are in progress. It is hoped that soon we will be able to treat sensitive and drug-resistant cases with a universal regimen, this would revolutionise treatment and take us another step closer towards elimination.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"The global dynamics of diabetes and tuberculosis: the impact of migration and policy implications.","10.1016/j.ijid.2017.01.018","2017 Mar","28153793","The convergence between tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) will represent a major public health challenge in the near future. DM increases the risk of developing TB by two to three times and also increases the risk of TB treatment failure, relapse, and death. The global prevalence of DM is predicted to rise significantly in the next two decades, particularly in some of the low- and middle-income countries with the highest TB burden. Migration may add further complexity to the effort to control the impact on TB of the growing DM pandemic. Migration may increase the risk of DM, although the magnitude of this association varies according to country of origin and ethnic group, due to genetic factors and lifestyle differences. Migrants with TB may have an increased prevalence of DM compared to the native population, and the risk of TB among persons with DM may be higher in migrants than in autochthonous populations. Screening for DM among migrants, screening migrants with DM for active and latent TB, and improving access to DM care, could contribute to mitigate the effects of DM on TB.Copyright © 2017 The Authors.

"Expected effects of adopting a 9 month regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: a population modelling analysis.","10.1016/S2213-2600(16)30423-4","2017 Mar","27989591","In May, 2016, WHO endorsed a 9 month regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that is cheaper and potentially more effective than the conventional, longer (20-24 month) therapy. We aimed to investigate the population-level implications of scaling up this new regimen.In this population modelling analysis, we developed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the introduction of this short-course regimen as an instantaneous switch in 2016. We projected the corresponding percentage reduction in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by 2024 compared with continued use of longer therapy. In the primary analysis in a representative southeast Asian setting, we assumed that the short-course regimen would double treatment access (through savings in resources or capacity) and achieve long-term efficacy at levels seen in preliminary cohort studies. We then did extensive sensitivity analyses to explore a range of alternative scenarios.Under the optimistic assumptions in the primary analysis, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2024 would be 3·3 (95% uncertainty range 2·2-5·6) per 100 000 population with the short-course regimen and 4·3 (2·9-7·6) per 100 000 population with continued use of longer therapy-ie, the short-course regimen could reduce incidence by 23% (10-38). Incidence would be reduced by 14% (4-28) if the new regimen affected only treatment effectiveness and by 11% (3-24) if it affected only treatment availability. Under more pessimistic assumptions, the short-course regimen would have minimal effect and even potential for harm-eg, when 30% of patients are ineligible for the new regimen because of second-line drug resistance, we projected a change in incidence of -2% (-20 to +28). The new regimen's effect was greater in settings with more ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but results were otherwise similar across settings with different levels of tuberculosis incidence and prevalence of multidrug resistance.The short-course regimen has potential to substantially lessen the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic, but this effect depends on its long-term efficacy, its ability to expand treatment access, and the role of second-line drug resistance.US National Institutes of Health and Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.Copyright © 2017 The Author(s).

Forecasts were made using the median of 100,000 projections using the parameters calculated via Monte Carlo methods.We found a decreasing number of new leprosy cases (-2.04 cases/year); this decrease is expected to continue by an estimated 20.28 +/- 10.00 cases by 2020, evidenced by a sustained decline in detection rate (from 11 to 2.9/100,000 inhabitants). Age groups that were most affected were 15-44 (40.13%) and 45-64 (38.83%) year olds. Multibacillary forms (MB) predominated (70.35%) and while gradually declining, between 10 and 30% developed disability grade 2 (DG2) (0.175 (0.110 - 0.337) DG2/MB cases), with a time delay between 0 to 15 years (median = 0). The proportion of MB clinic forms and DG2 increased and will continuously increase in the short term (0.036 +/- 0.018 logit (MB/total of cases).Corrientes is on the way to eliminating leprosy by 2020, however the increased proportion of MB clinical forms and DG2 signals a warning for disease control efforts."

A retrospective analysis of records of a mycobacterial reference laboratory found 135 cases with isolation of NTM.Clinical and epidemiological data were collected from the records of government health clinics and from the State notification system (TBWEB). The cases were geocoded by location based on the street address in the Mercator Transverse Universal projection, Datum SAD/69 and MapInfo software.Most patients were male (66.7%), older than 50 years (40%) and had only completed elementary schooling (38.5%). Associated health problems were found in 71.8% of the subjects, with 43.7% being HIV positive and 25.9% having had tuberculosis in the past. Hospitals were the most able institutions to diagnose cases (45.2%). Sputum was the most common material tested (63.0%) with the bacilloscopy being positive in 33.3% of cases. The most common mycobacteria species in the region were Mycobacterium avium and M. abscessus/M. massiliense/M. bolletii. When the regional reference municipality was analyzed, M. avium and M. fortuitum were the most common species isolated in the urban area.In the study region, mycobacteriosis most affected adult males with low schooling. Most patients presented comorbidities in particular co-infection with the HIV virus. M. avium is the most prevalent species in the region with the M. abscessus/M. massiliense/M. bolletii species being the main cause of nosocomial infections."
"Current and future trends in tuberculosis incidence in New York City: a dynamic modelling analysis.","10.1016/S2468-2667(17)30119-6","2017 Jul","29082351","After steady decline since the 1990s, tuberculosis (TB) incidence in New York City (NYC) and the United States (US) has flattened. The reasons for this trend and the implications for the future trajectory of TB in the US remain unclear.We developed a compartmental model of TB in NYC, parameterized with detailed epidemiological data. We ran the model under five alternative scenarios representing different explanations for recent declines in TB incidence. We evaluated each scenario's relative likelihood by comparing its output to available data. We used the most likely scenarios to explore drivers of TB incidence and predict future trajectories of the TB epidemic in NYC.Demographic changes and declining TB transmission alone were insufficient to explain recent trends in NYC TB incidence. Only scenarios that assumed contemporary changes in TB dynamics among the foreign-born - a declining rate of reactivation or a decrease in imported subclinical TB - could accurately describe the trajectory of TB incidence since 2007. In those scenarios, the projected decline in TB incidence from 2015 to 2025 varied from minimal [2·0%/year (95% credible interval 0·4-3·5%)] to similar to 2005 to 2009 trends [4·4%/year (2·5-6·4%)]. The primary factor differentiating optimistic from pessimistic projections was the degree to which improvements in TB dynamics among the foreign-born continued into the coming decade.Further progress against TB in NYC requires additional focus on the foreign-born population. Absent additional intervention in this group, TB incidence may not decline further."
"Priority-Setting for Novel Drug Regimens to Treat Tuberculosis: An Epidemiologic Model.","10.1371/journal.pmed.1002202","2017 Jan","28045934","Novel drug regimens are needed for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. New regimens aim to improve on characteristics such as duration, efficacy, and safety profile, but no single regimen is likely to be ideal in all respects. By linking these regimen characteristics to a novel regimen's ability to reduce TB incidence and mortality, we sought to prioritize regimen characteristics from a population-level perspective.We developed a dynamic transmission model of multi-strain TB epidemics in hypothetical populations reflective of the epidemiological situations in India (primary analysis), South Africa, the Philippines, and Brazil. We modeled the introduction of various novel rifampicin-susceptible (RS) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB regimens that differed on six characteristics, identified in consultation with a team of global experts: (1) efficacy, (2) duration, (3) ease of adherence, (4) medical contraindications, (5) barrier to resistance, and (6) baseline prevalence of resistance to the novel regimen. We compared scale-up of these regimens to a baseline reflective of continued standard of care. For our primary analysis situated in India, our model generated baseline TB incidence and mortality of 157 (95% uncertainty range [UR]: 113-187) and 16 (95% UR: 9-23) per 100,000 per year at the time of novel regimen introduction and RR TB incidence and mortality of 6 (95% UR: 4-10) and 0.6 (95% UR: 0.3-1.1) per 100,000 per year. An optimal RS TB regimen was projected to reduce 10-y TB incidence and mortality in the India-like scenario by 12% (95% UR: 6%-20%) and 11% (95% UR: 6%-20%), respectively, compared to current-care projections. An optimal RR TB regimen reduced RR TB incidence by an estimated 32% (95% UR: 18%-46%) and RR TB mortality by 30% (95% UR: 18%-44%). Efficacy was the greatest determinant of impact; compared to a novel regimen meeting all minimal targets only, increasing RS TB treatment efficacy from 94% to 99% reduced TB mortality by 6% (95% UR: 1%-13%, half the impact of a fully optimized regimen), and increasing the efficacy against RR TB from 76% to 94% lowered RR TB mortality by 13% (95% UR: 6%-23%). Reducing treatment duration or improving ease of adherence had smaller but still substantial impact: shortening RS TB treatment duration from 6 to 2 mo lowered TB mortality by 3% (95% UR: 1%-6%), and shortening RR TB treatment from 20 to 6 mo reduced RR TB mortality by 8% (95% UR: 4%-13%), while reducing nonadherence to the corresponding regimens by 50% reduced TB and RR TB mortality by 2% (95% UR: 1%-4%) and 6% (95% UR: 3%-10%), respectively. Limitations include sparse data on key model parameters and necessary simplifications to model structure and outcomes.In designing clinical trials of novel TB regimens, investigators should consider that even small changes in treatment efficacy may have considerable impact on TB-related incidence and mortality. Other regimen improvements may still have important benefits for resource allocation and outcomes such as patient quality of life."

Patients diagnosed with ocular tuberculosis were identified over the past 10 years (1 January 2006 to 31 December 2015) as recorded by individual Health Department jurisdictions per mandatory health notifications. The incidence rates were calculated based on the available Australian census data. Incidence rates were age and sex standardized.A total of 162 cases of ocular tuberculosis were identified across Australia over a 10-year time period. Of these, 156 participants were overseas born. The 10-year Australian incidence of ocular tuberculosis was 0.77 per 100,000 people. While there has been a downward trend in overall TB annual incidence rates from 2010 to 2015, over the same period the annual incidence of ocular TB has increased compared to the 4 previous years. Descriptive clinical data regarding the ocular manifestations of TB was available in 73/157 patients. In these 73 patients the commonest manifestations of ocular TB were unspecified uveitis (50.1%), focal, multifocal or serpiginous choroiditis or chorioretinitis (12.3%) and retinal vasculitis (11.0%). Of patients with ocular TB, 4/162 (2.47%) had associated pulmonary TB and 8/162 (4.94%) had associated systemic (non-pulmonary) TB. Systemic anti-TB therapy was administered to 161 patients.The annual Australian incidence of ocular tuberculosis was 0.077 per 100,000 people. Increasing notifications in the past 6 years may demonstrate increased awareness and changing diagnostic criteria of the disease in the Australian population."

These initiatives are hampered by a lack of information on this population.This study analysed the major South African mining recruitment database for the period 1973 to 2012 by calendar intervals and demographic and occupational characteristics. Changes in area of recruitment were mapped using a geographic information system.The database contained over 10 million contracts, reducible to 1.64 million individuals. Major trends relevant to health projection were a decline in gold mining employment, the major source of silicosis; increasing recruitment of female miners; and shifts in recruitment from foreign to South African miners, from the Eastern to the Northwestern parts of South Africa, and from company employees to contractors.These changes portend further externalisation of the burden of mining lung disease to home communities, as miners, particularly from the gold sector, leave the industry. The implications for health, surveillance and health services of the growing number of miners hired as contractors need further research, as does the health experience of female miners. Overall, the information in this report can be used for projection of disease burden and direction of compensation, screening and treatment services for the ex-miner population throughout Southern Africa."
"Diagnosis of Tuberculosis in HIV Co-infected Individuals: Current Status, Challenges and Opportunities for the Future.","10.1111/sji.12567","2017 Aug","28513865","Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most important causes of death among people co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The diagnosis of TB remains challenging in HIV co-infected individuals, due to a high frequency of smear-negative disease and high rates of extrapulmonary TB. Accurate, ease of use and rapid diagnosis of active TB are critical to the World Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy by 2050. Traditional laboratory techniques do not provide rapid and accurate results to effectively manage HIV co-infected patients. Over the last decade, molecular methods have provided significant steps in the fight against TB. However, many HIV co-infected patients do not have access to these molecular diagnostic tests. Given the costs closely related with confirming a TB diagnosis in HIV patients, an overtreatment for TB is used in this patient population. Nowadays, an estimated US $8 billion a year is required to provide TB treatment, which is very high compared with making an important strategy to improve the current diagnostic tests. This review focuses on current advances in diagnosing active TB with an emphasis on the diagnosis of HIV-associated TB. Also discussed are the main challenges that need to be overcome for improving an adequate initial diagnosis of active TB in HIV-positive patients.© 2017 The Foundation for the Scandinavian Journal of Immunology."
"Hybrid methodology for tuberculosis incidence time-series forecasting based on ARIMA and a NAR neural network.","10.1017/S0950268816003216","2017 Apr","28115032","Tuberculosis (TB) affects people globally and is being reconsidered as a serious public health problem in China. Reliable forecasting is useful for the prevention and control of TB. This study proposes a hybrid model combining autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network for forecasting the incidence of TB from January 2007 to March 2016. Prediction performance was compared between the hybrid model and the ARIMA model. The best-fit hybrid model was combined with an ARIMA (3,1,0) × (0,1,1)12 and NAR neural network with four delays and 12 neurons in the hidden layer. The ARIMA-NAR hybrid model, which exhibited lower mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of 0·2209, 0·1373, and 0·0406, respectively, in the modelling performance, could produce more accurate forecasting of TB incidence compared to the ARIMA model. This study shows that developing and applying the ARIMA-NAR hybrid model is an effective method to fit the linear and nonlinear patterns of time-series data, and this model could be helpful in the prevention and control of TB."
"MDR-TB treatment as prevention: The projected population-level impact of expanded treatment for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.","10.1371/journal.pone.0172748","2017","28273116","In 2013, approximately 480,000 people developed active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), while only 97,000 started MDR-TB treatment. We sought to estimate the impact of improving access to MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment, under multiple diagnostic algorithm and treatment regimen scenarios, on ten-year projections of MDR-TB incidence and mortality.We constructed a dynamic transmission model of an MDR-TB epidemic in an illustrative East/Southeast Asian setting. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we investigated a wide array of potential epidemic trajectories consistent with current notification data and known TB epidemiology.Despite an overall projected decline in TB incidence, data-consistent simulations suggested that MDR-TB incidence is likely to rise between 2015 and 2025 under continued 2013 treatment practices, although with considerable uncertainty (median 17% increase, 95% Uncertainty Range [UR] -38% to +137%). But if, by 2017, all identified active TB patients with previously-treated TB could be tested for drug susceptibility, and 85% of those with MDR-TB could initiate MDR-appropriate treatment, then MDR-TB incidence in 2025 could be reduced by 26% (95% UR 4-52%) relative to projections under continued current practice. Also expanding this drug-susceptibility testing and appropriate MDR-TB treatment to treatment-naïve as well as previously-treated TB cases, by 2020, could reduce MDR-TB incidence in 2025 by 29% (95% UR 6-55%) compared to continued current practice. If this diagnosis and treatment of all MDR-TB in known active TB cases by 2020 could be implemented via a novel second-line regimen with similar effectiveness and tolerability as current first-line therapy, a 54% (95% UR 20-74%) reduction in MDR-TB incidence compared to current-practice projections could be achieved by 2025.Expansion of diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB, even using current sub-optimal second-line regimens, is expected to significantly decrease MDR-TB incidence at the population level. Focusing MDR diagnostic efforts on previously-treated cases is an efficient first-step approach."
"Local spatial variations analysis of smear-positive tuberculosis in Xinjiang using Geographically Weighted Regression model.","10.1186/s12889-016-3723-4","2016 Oct 6","27716319","The spatial interplay between socioeconomic factors and tuberculosis (TB) cases contributes to the understanding of regional tuberculosis burdens. Historically, local Poisson Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) has allowed for the identification of the geographic disparities of TB cases and their relevant socioeconomic determinants, thereby forecasting local regression coefficients for the relations between the incidence of TB and its socioeconomic determinants. Therefore, the aims of this study were to: (1) identify the socioeconomic determinants of geographic disparities of smear positive TB in Xinjiang, China (2) confirm if the incidence of smear positive TB and its associated socioeconomic determinants demonstrate spatial variability (3) compare the performance of two main models: one is Ordinary Least Square Regression (OLS), and the other local GWR model.Reported smear-positive TB cases in Xinjiang were extracted from the TB surveillance system database during 2004-2010. The average number of smear-positive TB cases notified in Xinjiang was collected from 98 districts/counties. The population density (POPden), proportion of minorities (PROmin), number of infectious disease network reporting agencies (NUMagen), proportion of agricultural population (PROagr), and per capita annual gross domestic product (per capita GDP) were gathered from the Xinjiang Statistical Yearbook covering a period from 2004 to 2010. The OLS model and GWR model were then utilized to investigate socioeconomic determinants of smear-positive TB cases. Geoda 1.6.7, and GWR 4.0 software were used for data analysis.Our findings indicate that the relations between the average number of smear-positive TB cases notified in Xinjiang and their socioeconomic determinants (POPden, PROmin, NUMagen, PROagr, and per capita GDP) were significantly spatially non-stationary. This means that in some areas more smear-positive TB cases could be related to higher socioeconomic determinant regression coefficients, but in some areas more smear-positive TB cases were found to do with lower socioeconomic determinant regression coefficients. We also found out that the GWR model could be better exploited to geographically differentiate the relationships between the average number of smear-positive TB cases and their socioeconomic determinants, which could interpret the dataset better (adjusted R 2 = 0.912, AICc = 1107.22) than the OLS model (adjusted R 2 = 0.768, AICc = 1196.74).POPden, PROmin, NUMagen, PROagr, and per capita GDP are socioeconomic determinants of smear-positive TB cases. Comprehending the spatial heterogeneity of POPden, PROmin, NUMagen, PROagr, per capita GDP, and smear-positive TB cases could provide valuable information for TB precaution and control strategies."

At that time funding agencies began to support formal investigation of aerosol therapy which until then had been the subject of case reports of individual investigators. Over the last decade, proponents of aerosol therapy have increased in number within the TB research community as the incidence of multiple and extremely drug resistant TB has increased dramatically around the world. Aerosol therapy offers the potential to deliver drug at target concentrations directly into the lungs, use the alveolar-capillary interface to achieve systemic levels, while reducing the risk of systemic toxicity seen with parentally administered doses. In addition, there are insufficient new drugs in the pipeline to anticipate the appearance of a new regimen in time to assure future control of drug resistance. Consequently, alternative strategies are critical to achieving global TB control, and inhaled therapies should be considered as one such strategy.Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier B.V."

"Risk of self-reported symptoms or diagnosis of active tuberculosis in relationship to low body mass index, diabetes and their co-occurrence.","10.1111/tmi.12763","2016 Oct","27495971","Globally, tuberculosis prevalence has declined, but its risk factors have varied across place and time - low body mass index (BMI) has persisted while diabetes has increased. Using India's National Family Health Survey (NFHS), wave 3 and World Health Survey (WHS) data, we examined their relationships to support projection of future trends and targeted control efforts.Multivariate logistic regressions at the individual level with and without diabetes/BMI interactions assessed the relationship between tuberculosis, diabetes and low BMI and the importance of risk factor co-occurrence. Population-level analyses examined how tuberculosis incidence and prevalence varied with diabetes/low BMI co-occurrence.In NFHS, diabetic individuals had higher predicted tuberculosis risks (diabetic vs. non-diabetic: 2.50% vs. 0.63% at low BMI; 0.81% vs. 0.20% at normal BMI; 0.37% vs. 0.09% at high BMI), which were not significantly different when modelled independently or allowing for risk modification with diabetes/low BMI co-occurrence. WHS findings were generally consistent. Population-level analysis found that diabetes/low BMI co-occurrence may be associated with elevated tuberculosis risk, although its predicted effect on tuberculosis incidence/prevalence was generally ≤0.2 percentage points and not robustly statistically significant.Concerns about the additional elevation of tuberculosis risk from diabetes/low BMI co-occurrence and hence the need to coordinate tuberculosis control efforts around the nexus of co-occurring diabetes and low BMI may be premature. However, study findings robustly support the importance of individually targeting low BMI and diabetes as part of ongoing tuberculosis control efforts.© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

The present study estimates T2DM incidence in Fijian adults from T2DM prevalence estimates assembled from surveys of 25-64 year old adults conducted over 30 years (n = 14,288).T2DM prevalence by five-year age group from five population-based risk factor surveys conducted over 1980-2011 were variously adjusted for urban-rural residency, ethnicity, and sex to previous censuses (1976, 1986, 1996, 2009) to improve representativeness. Prevalence estimates were then used to calculate T2DM incidence based on birth cohorts from the age-period (Lexis) matrix following the Styblo technique, first used to estimate annual risk of tuberculosis infection (incidence) from sequential Mantoux population surveys. Poisson regression of year, age, sex, and ethnicity strata (n = 160) was used to develop projections of T2DM prevalence and incidence to 2020 based on various scenarios of population weight measured by body mass index (BMI) change.T2DM prevalence and annual incidence increased in Fiji over 1980-2011. Prevalence was higher in Indians and men than i-Taukei and women. Incidence was higher in Indians and women. From regression analyses, absolute reductions of 2.6 to 5.1% in T2DM prevalence (13-26% lower), and 0.5-0.9 per 1000 person-years in incidence (8-14% lower), could be expected in 2020 in adults if mean population weight could be reduced by 1-4 kg, compared to the current period trend in weight gain.This is the first application of the Styblo technique to calculate T2DM incidence from population-based prevalence surveys over time. Reductions in population BMI are predicted to reduce T2DM incidence and prevalence in Fiji among adults aged 25-64 years."

We aimed to assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness of strategies to achieve these targets in China, India, and South Africa.We examined intervention scenarios developed in consultation with country stakeholders, which scaled up existing interventions to high but feasible coverage by 2025. Nine independent modelling groups collaborated to estimate policy outcomes, and we estimated the cost of each scenario by synthesising service use estimates, empirical cost data, and expert opinion on implementation strategies. We estimated health effects (ie, disability-adjusted life-years averted) and resource implications for 2016-35, including patient-incurred costs. To assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, we compared scenarios with a base case representing continued current practice.Incremental tuberculosis service costs differed by scenario and country, and in some cases they more than doubled existing funding needs. In general, expansion of tuberculosis services substantially reduced patient-incurred costs and, in India and China, produced net cost savings for most interventions under a societal perspective. In all three countries, expansion of access to care produced substantial health gains. Compared with current practice and conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds, most intervention approaches seemed highly cost-effective.Expansion of tuberculosis services seems cost-effective for high-burden countries and could generate substantial health and economic benefits for patients, although substantial new funding would be required.

We aimed to assess whether these targets are feasible in three high-burden countries with contrasting epidemiology and previous programmatic achievements.11 independently developed mathematical models of tuberculosis transmission projected the epidemiological impact of currently available tuberculosis interventions for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China, India, and South Africa. Models were calibrated with data on tuberculosis incidence and mortality in 2012. Representatives from national tuberculosis programmes and the advocacy community provided distinct country-specific intervention scenarios, which included screening for symptoms, active case finding, and preventive therapy.Aggressive scale-up of any single intervention scenario could not achieve the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets in any country. However, the models projected that, in the South Africa national tuberculosis programme scenario, a combination of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy for individuals on antiretroviral therapy, expanded facility-based screening for symptoms of tuberculosis at health centres, and improved tuberculosis care could achieve a 55% reduction in incidence (range 31-62%) and a 72% reduction in mortality (range 64-82%) compared with 2015 levels. For India, and particularly for China, full scale-up of all interventions in tuberculosis-programme performance fell short of the 2025 targets, despite preventing a cumulative 3·4 million cases. The advocacy scenarios illustrated the high impact of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis.Major reductions in tuberculosis burden seem possible with current interventions.

Tuberculosis as a chronic and highly infectious disease is prevalent in almost every part of the globe. More than 95% of TB mortality occurs in low/middle income countries. In 2014, approximately 10 million people were diagnosed with active TB and two million died from the disease. In this study, our aim is to compare the predictive powers of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and neural network auto-regression (SARIMA-NNAR) models of TB incidence and analyse its seasonality in South Africa.TB incidence cases data from January 2010 to December 2015 were extracted from the Eastern Cape Health facility report of the electronic Tuberculosis Register (ERT.Net). A SARIMA model and a combined model of SARIMA model and a neural network auto-regression (SARIMA-NNAR) model were used in analysing and predicting the TB data from 2010 to 2015. Simulation performance parameters of mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean percent error (MPE), mean absolute scaled error (MASE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were applied to assess the better performance of prediction between the models.Though practically, both models could predict TB incidence, the combined model displayed better performance. For the combined model, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), second-order AIC (AICc) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are 288.56, 308.31 and 299.09 respectively, which were lower than the SARIMA model with corresponding values of 329.02, 327.20 and 341.99, respectively. The seasonality trend of TB incidence was forecast to have a slightly increased seasonal TB incidence trend from the SARIMA-NNAR model compared to the single model.The combined model indicated a better TB incidence forecasting with a lower AICc. The model also indicates the need for resolute intervention to reduce infectious disease transmission with co-infection with HIV and other concomitant diseases, and also at festival peak periods."

Molecular epidemiology studies, together with recent genomic evidence, provide proof that some drug-resistant strains are highly transmissible with documented epidemic spread. The potential for epidemic replacement of drug-susceptible with drug-resistant strains provides strong motivation for renewed emphasis on TB drug and vaccine development. It also reflects the need for enhanced infection control measures in health care and congregate settings, especially in TB endemic areas. The exploration of preventive therapy options for close contacts of patients with infectious drug-resistant TB also warrants further exploration, in an attempt to break the transmission cycle. Increased population mobility and large scale cross-border migration imply that the inexorable rise of drug-resistant TB is not geographically confined; it is a global concern that poses a very real threat to TB endemic and non-endemic settings. Failure to find new solutions will compromise traditional TB control efforts and derail momentum toward future TB elimination.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

The supplementary material of this article includes target product profiles, as developed by early 2016, defining nine priority digital health concepts and products that are strategically positioned to enhance TB action at the country level.The content of this work is ©the authors or their employers.

"CKD and Infectious Diseases in Asia Pacific: Challenges and Opportunities.","10.1053/j.ajkd.2016.01.017","2016 Jul","26943982","The exact number of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) in Asia Pacific is uncertain. In numeric terms, the region is home to the largest population of patients with untreated chronic kidney failure. The climatic, geographic, social, cultural, economic, and environmental diversity within this region is higher than in any other part of the world. Large parts of the region face a climate-related burden of infectious diseases. Infections contribute to the development and progression of CKD and complicate the course of patients with pre-existing CKD (especially those on dialysis therapy or who are immunosuppressed), increase the cost of CKD care, and contribute to mortality and morbidity. Kidney involvement is a feature of several infectious diseases prevalent in Asia Pacific. Examples include malaria, leptospirosis, scrub typhus, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C virus, dengue hemorrhagic fever, and Hantaan virus infections. The contribution of infection-associated acute kidney injury to the overall burden of CKD has not been evaluated systematically. Research is needed to quantify the impact of infections on kidney health by undertaking prospective studies. Nephrologists need to work with infectious disease research groups and government infection surveillance and control programs. Copyright © 2016 National Kidney Foundation, Inc.

"ClassTR: Classifying Within-Host Heterogeneity Based on Tandem Repeats with Application to Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infections.","10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004475","2016 Feb","26829497","Genomic tools have revealed genetically diverse pathogens within some hosts. Within-host pathogen diversity, which we refer to as ""complex infection"", is increasingly recognized as a determinant of treatment outcome for infections like tuberculosis. Complex infection arises through two mechanisms: within-host mutation (which results in clonal heterogeneity) and reinfection (which results in mixed infections). Estimates of the frequency of within-host mutation and reinfection in populations are critical for understanding the natural history of disease. These estimates influence projections of disease trends and effects of interventions. The genotyping technique MLVA (multiple loci variable-number tandem repeats analysis) can identify complex infections, but the current method to distinguish clonal heterogeneity from mixed infections is based on a rather simple rule. Here we describe ClassTR, a method which leverages MLVA information from isolates collected in a population to distinguish mixed infections from clonal heterogeneity. We formulate the resolution of complex infections into their constituent strains as an optimization problem, and show its NP-completeness. We solve it efficiently by using mixed integer linear programming and graph decomposition. Once the complex infections are resolved into their constituent strains, ClassTR probabilistically classifies isolates as clonally heterogeneous or mixed by using a model of tandem repeat evolution. We first compare ClassTR with the standard rule-based classification on 100 simulated datasets. ClassTR outperforms the standard method, improving classification accuracy from 48% to 80%. We then apply ClassTR to a sample of 436 strains collected from tuberculosis patients in a South African community, of which 92 had complex infections. We find that ClassTR assigns an alternate classification to 18 of the 92 complex infections, suggesting important differences in practice. By explicitly modeling tandem repeat evolution, ClassTR helps to improve our understanding of the mechanisms driving within-host diversity of pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis. "
"Forecasting Cause-Specific Mortality in Korea up to Year 2032.","10.3346/jkms.2016.31.8.1181","2016 Aug","27478326","Forecasting cause-specific mortality can help estimate the future burden of diseases and provide a clue for preventing diseases. Our objective was to forecast the mortality for causes of death in the future (2013-2032) based on the past trends (1983-2012) in Korea. The death data consisted of 12 major causes of death from 1983 to 2012 and the population data consisted of the observed and estimated populations (1983-2032) in Korea. The modified age-period-cohort model with an R-based program, nordpred software, was used to forecast future mortality. Although the age-standardized rates for the world standard population for both sexes are expected to decrease from 2008-2012 to 2028-2032 (males: -31.4%, females: -32.3%), the crude rates are expected to increase (males: 46.3%, females: 33.4%). The total number of deaths is also estimated to increase (males: 52.7%, females: 41.9%). Additionally, the largest contribution to the overall change in deaths was the change in the age structures. Several causes of death are projected to increase in both sexes (cancer, suicide, heart diseases, pneumonia and Alzheimer's disease), while others are projected to decrease (cerebrovascular diseases, liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, traffic accidents, chronic lower respiratory diseases, and pulmonary tuberculosis). Cancer is expected to be the highest cause of death for both the 2008-2012 and 2028-2032 time periods in Korea. To reduce the disease burden, projections of the future cause-specific mortality should be used as fundamental data for developing public health policies. "
"Connectivity of diagnostic technologies: improving surveillance and accelerating tuberculosis elimination.","10.5588/ijtld.16.0015","2016 Aug","27393530","In regard to tuberculosis (TB) and other major global epidemics, the use of new diagnostic tests is increasing dramatically, including in resource-limited countries. Although there has never been as much digital information generated, this data source has not been exploited to its full potential. In this opinion paper, we discuss lessons learned from the global scale-up of these laboratory devices and the pathway to tapping the potential of laboratory-generated information in the field of TB by using connectivity. Responding to the demand for connectivity, innovative third-party players have proposed solutions that have been widely adopted by field users of the Xpert(®) MTB/RIF assay. The experience associated with the utilisation of these systems, which facilitate the monitoring of wide laboratory networks, stressed the need for a more global and comprehensive approach to diagnostic connectivity. In addition to facilitating the reporting of test results, the mobility of digital information allows the sharing of information generated in programme settings. When they become easily accessible, these data can be used to improve patient care, disease surveillance and drug discovery. They should therefore be considered as a public health good. We list several examples of concrete initiatives that should allow data sources to be combined to improve the understanding of the epidemic, support the operational response and, finally, accelerate TB elimination. With the many opportunities that the pooling of data associated with the TB epidemic can provide, pooling of this information at an international level has become an absolute priority."

In Uganda, the child TB cases reported in 2012 made up less than 3 % of the total cases while recent modelling estimates it at 15-20 % of adult cases. Mapping of these cases in Kampala district most especially for the children under five years would reflect recent transmission in the various communities in the district. We therefore conducted a retrospective study of reported child TB cases in Kampala district Uganda for 2009-2010 to provide an estimate of child TB incidence and map the cases.This was a retrospective cross-sectional study on data collected from the health unit TB registers in the five divisions of Kampala district, Uganda. The data was a starting point in preparation for a TB Vaccine study in children. The extracted data spanned a period from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2010. The projected population of children below 15 years was 637,922 in 2009 and 744,750 in 2010 for Kampala district. We based our projections on the National Bureau of Statistics most recent census report of 2002 before the study duration while assuming a population growth rate of 3.7 % each year. We captured the data into EPI DATA 3.1 and analysed it using STATA version 12.We accessed 15,499 records and analysed 1167 records that were of children below 15 years old. The child TB cases represented 7.5 % (7.3 in 2009 & 7.6 % in 2010) of all the registered cases in Kampala district. The females were 47 % and the median age was 4 years (IQR 1, 10). The percent of children less than 5 years old was 54 %. The percent of pulmonary TB cases was 89 % (1041/1167) with 15 % smear positive. The proportion of extra-pulmonary TB cases was 11 % (126/1167). Among those that tested for HIV, 60 % (359/620) had test results available with an HIV co-infection rate of 47 % (168/359). Antiretroviral treatment uptake was 24 % among the co-infected. The incidence of child TB in Kampala was 56 (95 % CI 50-62) per 100,000 in 2009 and 44 (95 % CI 40-49) per 100,000 in 2010. Most of the TB cases (60 % (410/685)) in Kampala live in slum areas.There was a higher child TB incidence of 56 per 100,000 in 2009 compared with 44 per 100,000 in 2010. The percentage of child TB cases was much higher at 7.5 % of all the reported TB cases than the WHO reported national average.

"The Distribution of Fitness Costs of Resistance-Conferring Mutations Is a Key Determinant for the Future Burden of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis: A Model-Based Analysis.","10.1093/cid/civ579","2015 Oct 15","26409276","Drug resistance poses a serious challenge for the control of tuberculosis in many settings. It is well established that the expected future trend in resistance depends on the reproductive fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the variability in fitness between strains with different resistance-conferring mutations has been largely ignored when making these predictions.We developed a novel approach for incorporating the variable fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations and for tracking this distribution of fitness costs over time within a transmission model. We used this approach to describe the effects of realistic fitness cost distributions on the future prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis.The shape of the distribution of fitness costs was a strong predictor of the long-term prevalence of resistance. While, as expected, lower average fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations were associated with more severe epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis, fitness distributions with greater variance also led to higher levels of drug resistance. For example, compared to simulations in which the fitness cost of resistance was fixed, introducing a realistic amount of variance resulted in a 40% increase in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis after 20 years.The differences in the fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations are a key determinant of the future burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Future studies that can better establish the range of fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations will improve projections and thus facilitate better public health planning efforts.© The Author 2015.

Descriptive statistics and a back-propagation artificial neural network were adopted to analyze the data.There were significant correlations between the incidence of tuberculosis and the meteorological factors in the corresponding year and previous years. Among these correlations, wind speed was the factor with the strongest influence on tuberculosis (the standardized significance was 100%). Additionally, all prediction models would successfully established, suggesting the use of a collection of meteorological factors spanning from three years ago to the present is superior to the use of single data.The incidence of tuberculosis in Beijing area is correlated to meteorological factors in the current year and previous years, which verifies the practicality of the theory of five circuits and six qi."

The present study forecasts the incidence of smear positive TB in Iran.This a longitudinal study using monthly tuberculosis incidence data recorded in the Iranian National Tuberculosis Control Program. The sum of registered cases in each month created 84 time points. Time series methods were used for analysis. Based on the residual chart of ACF, PACF, Ljung-Box tests and the lowest levels of AIC and BIC, the most suitable model was selected.From April 2005 until March 2012, 34012 smear positive TB cases were recorded. The mean of TB monthly incidence was 404.9 (SD=54.7). The highest number of cases was registered in May and the difference in monthly incidence of smear positive TB was significant (P<0.001). SARIMA (0,1,1)(0,1,1)12 was selected as the most adequate model for prediction. It was predicted that the incidence of smear positive TB for 2015 will be about 9.8 per 100,000 people.Based on the seasonal pattern of smear positive TB recorded cases, seasonal ARIMA model was suitable for predicting its incidence.

This study aimed to determine predictive factors for death in patients with tuberculosis to set priorities for public heath interventions to reduce mortality in these patients. This nested case-control study was carried out in Mazandaran province of Islamic Republic of Iran among tuberculosis patients who were treated during 2002-2009. Each deceased patient was individually matched with a control patient according to sex, age, area of involvement and time of follow-up. Potential risk factors for death were evaluated using multivariate conditional logistic regression models. From 2206 patients 376 cases and 376 matched controls were selected. Only positive serology for HIV (OR = 19.1), history of kidney disease (OR = 6.81) and use of immunosuppressant drugs (OR = 3.96) significantly increased the risk of death in tuberculosis patients. These potentially modifiable risk factors could be taken into account in preventive interventions for tuberculosis patients in our country. "

The evidence of Pott's disease was considered specific for TB, with other bone changes, such as rib lesions, as non-specific. Limitations of the data are discussed. Most evidence for TB comes from skeletons from the northern hemisphere, particularly in Europe in the late Medieval period (12(th)-16th centuries AD), but there is early evidence in the Near/Middle East and Egypt. Many parts of Africa, Asia and Australasia have very little or no evidence. aDNA analysis has provided data on species and strains of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex organisms affecting people in the past. The extant data suggest the first epidemiological transition (Neolithic agriculture and permanent settlements) led to an increase in TB, with later increases in urban environments of the late Medieval period. A number of causative factors were at play. Future research, particularly using biomolecular analysis, has the potential to further contribute to our understanding of the origin and evolution of TB, thus merging the disciplines of palaeopathology and evolutionary medicine.

A controversial plan to depopulate infected herds and repopulate them with disease-free wood bison was rejected in 1990 because of significant public concern. Since then, technical advances in vaccine technology, genetic salvage, selective culling, and diagnostic test development have occurred. Containment strategies to reduce further spread of these diseases are a necessary first step; recent progress has been made in this area, but challenges remain. This progress has produced more options for management of these herds in northern Canada, and it is time to consider wood bison conservation and long-term disease eradication as equally important goals that must satisfy concerns of conservation groups, agriculture sectors, aboriginal groups, and the general public. Management of wildlife disease reservoirs in other areas, including Yellowstone and Riding Mountain national parks, has demonstrated that effective disease management is possible. Although combinations of different strategies, including vaccination, genetic salvage techniques, and selective culling, that use sensitive and specific diagnostic tests may offer alternatives to depopulation/repopulation, they also have logistic constraints and cost implications that will need consideration in a multistakeholder, collaborative-management framework. We feel the time is right for this discussion, so a long-term solution to this problem can be applied. "

TB poses formidable challenges to the global health at the public health and scientific level by acquiring gene mutation into anti TB drugs specially rifampin and isoniazid which leads resistant to drug regime and treatment forms. Our tools to combat MDR (multidrug resistant) TB are dangerously out of date and ineffective. Besides new tools (TB drugs, vaccines, diagnostics), we also need new strategies to identify key Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human host interaction. It is all equally important that we build up high quality clinical trial capacity and bio banks for TB biomarkers identification. But most important is global commitment at all levels to roll back TB before it expose us again. Rapid development of drug resistance caused by M. tuberculosis has lead to measure resistance accurately and easily. This knowledge will certainly help us to understand how to prevent the occurrence of drug resistance as well as identifying genes associated with new drug resistance. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This review discusses the major contributions of TB transmission models in general, namely, the ability to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of TB. We focus particularly on those elements that are important to appropriately understand the role of TB diagnosis and treatment (i.e., what elements of better diagnosis or treatment are likely to have greatest population-level impact) and yet remain poorly understood at present. It is essential for modellers, decision-makers, and epidemiologists alike to recognize these outstanding gaps in knowledge and understand their potential influence on model projections that may guide critical policy choices (e.g., investment and scale-up decisions).

In support of the drafting of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we estimate what the grand convergence investment case might achieve-and what investment would be required-by 2030.Our projection focuses on a sub-set of low-income (LIC) or lower-middle-income countries (LMIC). We start with a country-based (bottom-up) analysis of the costs and impact of scaling up reproductive, maternal, and child health tools, and select HIV and malaria interventions. We then incorporate global (top-down) analyses of the costs and impacts of scaling up existing tools for tuberculosis, additional HIV interventions, the costs to strengthen health systems, and the costs and benefits from scaling up new health interventions over the time horizon of this forecast. These data are then allocated to individual countries to provide an aggregate projection of potential cost and impact at the country level. Finally, incremental costs of R&D for low-income economies and the costs of addressing NTDs are added to provide a global total cost estimate of the investment scenario.Compared with a constant coverage scenario, there would be more than 60 million deaths averted in LIC and 70 million deaths averted in LMIC between 2016 and 2030. For the years 2015, 2020, 2025, and 2030, the incremental costs of convergence in LIC would be (US billion) $24.3, $21.8, $24.7, and $27, respectively; in LMIC, the incremental costs would be (US billion) $34.75, $38.9, $48.7, and $56.3, respectively.Key health outcomes in low- and low-middle income countries can significantly converge with those of wealthier countries by 2030, and the notion of a ""grand convergence"" may serve as a unifying theme for health indicators in the SDGs."

We describe the radiological findings in children under 3 years of age investigated for TB in the district of Manhiça, southern Mozambique, an area with a high prevalence of TB and HIV.Digital antero-posterior and lateral projections were performed and reviewed by two independent readers, using a standardized template. Readers included a local pediatrician and a pediatric radiologist blinded to all clinical information. International consensus case definitions for intra-thoracic TB in children were applied.A total of 766 children were evaluated of whom 43 (5.6%) had TB. The most frequent lesion found in TB cases was air space consolidation (65.1%), followed by suggestive hilar lymphadenopathy (17.1%) and pleural effusion (7.0%). Air space consolidation was significantly more common in TB cases than in non-TB cases (odds ratio 8.9; 95% CI: 1.6-50.5), as were hilar lymphadenopathy (OR 17.2; 95% CI: 5.7-52.1). The only case with miliary infiltrates and 3 with pleural effusions occurred in HIV-infected children.Frequent air space consolidation complicates radiological distinction between TB and bacterial pneumonia in young children, underscoring the need for epidemiological contextualization and consideration of all relevant signs and symptoms."
